# [The Lazy Person's Guide To A More Productive Life](https://anindigoday.com/the-lazy-persons-guide-to-a-more-productive-life/)
I kind of pride myself on somehow being kinda lazy, but still having most of my shit together. And I think it’s just the ability to be productive and organized, and prioritizing self care. But, yes, also being a childless Millennial helps.

But even if you do have kids, or not, or whatever, I think there are times you can make your life feel a bit more productive even if you only have a short window to do so. You may feel like you’re working all the time but still not getting anything done.

And honestly, it doesn’t have to be that way. A few simple changes can help you achieve more in less time without working harder. So let’s dive into my lazy person’s guide to a more productive life.

The Lazy Person’s Guide To A More Productive Life
----------

### Prioritize Your Goals ###

First and foremost, you have to decide what’s a priority. By wasting time on smaller tasks, or ones that don’t really move the needle, you’ll be doing more work with fewer results in life.

When you focus on the most important goals, you’ll automatically feel more productive. And once that goal has finally been achieved, you’ll feel like a million bucks. You’ll feel more accomplished, and honestly, you may start the snowball effect where you get on a roll. And then you can go back to being lazy.

### Break Tasks Into Smaller Pieces ###

If large projects feel too overwhelming making you lazy and not productive, then break them into smaller tasks. By breaking a large project down into smaller more manageable tasks you’ll feel more confident in knocking them out. And again, after you knock off one thing from your to-do list, you’re more inclined to knock another out, and so on.

I do this a lot with [my Asana tasks](https://anindigoday.com/how-to-use-asana/). If I have a big project I need to work on, I am bound to be overwhelmed by it and just avoid it all. Instead, I break the project into small tasks and assign them to myself to knock out. And without fail, every time, I end up getting through MANY of the smaller tasks making my way through these projects more easily.

### Eliminate Distractions ###

If you want to knock out some productivity, you better eliminate the distractions. This may mean putting your phone on Do Not Disturb so you can knock out whatever task is at hand. Or maybe it’s turning off the TV to get some work done. If there are distractions keeping you from your optimal productivity so you can more quickly get things done and embrace your lazy, eliminate them!

### Automate Whenever Possible ###

The key to being lazy and productive? Automate. Whenever possible, automate whatever it is you can. From your bill pay, to subscribing to the things you buy all the time on repeat, to automating meal planning and grocery shopping, and so on.

### Delegate Tasks ###

Delegating tasks is key to offloading things from your to-do list. Whether it’s home chores that you offload to your kids or spouse, or start to flex your manager muscles at work and delegate more tasks to your team because you’ve been taking on more than you need to, it’s time to delegate.

I think some of us (hi, it’s me) tend to be control freaks and want to do all the things. I do this a lot in literally everything and anything I do in life. So this is a good reminder for myself.

### Outsource Tasks ###

After you automate and delegate what you can, then you outsource. While this is a privilege to be able to do, I do think it’s also important to look at the cost-benefit. Analyzing what you can get done in an hour versus hiring a task out instead is a good way to see what’s worth it. If you can work for an hour and make $100, then maybe it’s worth hiring someone to help with something for $50 to take it off your plate.

There are also things like meal planning that can be outsourced with meal delivery so it’s one less thing you’re doing. Again, many of these are a privilege to have access to, but if you have the means, these can allow you to open up your schedule with more free time.

### Optimize Your Environment ###

If you want to knock out some productivity, you should probably find your optimal productivity settings. Everyone may be different, but whatever it is that you find helps to get you into the zone, make sure you do that EVERY time.

For me, when I know I need to get into a work groove, it’s [my office vibes Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4XwyN003POeDIEt6U0gMNn?si=7fa30a3975ba4881) that instantly gets me there. I can zone out and knock out work like a mad woman.

Maybe it’s plugging in some AirPods and listening to a book or podcast, or 90’s hip hop. Whatever it is, know that if it’s time to be productive, you must set the mood in a sense.

### Optimize Your Tasks And Routine ###

I think one of the things I pride myself on is problem solving and being efficient. I think it maybe is the waitress in me and working in a restaurant for 15 years. But we were required to manage a lot at once and be as efficient as possible. And this is something I try to do at all times in my life.

Whether it’s running errands in an efficient manner, or optimiznig my routine, these are ways to be super productive and then allows you to embrace your lazy moments. Take running errands as an example. There’s no need to run all over town to do all your errands in one single day just because you want to knock it out. Break up your errands based on location and priority. If you’re going to be near XYZ later this week for something else, do it then! Saving time where you can will result in ultimate lazy gains.

### Embrace Your Lazy ###

Sometimes you just need to be lazy so you can be your best self. This is the recharging that we need and it means we can be a better version of ourselves. And usually a more productive one. And I think it’s important to recognize when you need to be lazy and just be.

### Try Setting A Timer ###

Setting a timer to knock things out can be a great way to be productive. Set a timer for an hour and get to cleaning and tidying the house. Or set a timer and knock out the project you’ve been procrastinating on.

I like using the Pomodoro Technique, which is a productivity method that involves breaking work into intervals, usually 25 minutes long. This allows me to have bursts of productivity which I think is necessary and most beneficial to us lazy people.

### Trim The Fat ###

If you want to live your optimal lazy life, while still being productive, you have to get rid of the unnecessary crap in your life. That may mean saying no to things, turning down social invites or obligations that you don’t really need to go to. And it may also mean getting rid of the people in your life who are taking up valuable time or energy who don’t deserve it.

When you just keep people in your life who are VIPs, you may free up some time while also offloading unecessary drama and negative energy.
