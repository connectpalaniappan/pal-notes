## Highlights
- central platform that can scale elastically to handle all the streams of data in a company. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=46))
- Kafka is a true storage system built to store data for as long as you might like. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=46))
- capabilities in Kafka let you compute derived streams and datasets dynamically off of your streams with far less code. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=49))
- Hadoop lets you store and periodically process file data at a very large scale. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=52))
- power custom applications built to trigger off of these same data streams. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=62))
- message bus for event-driven microservices, stream-processing applications, and large-scale data pipelines. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=76))
- Pub/sub systems often have a broker, a central point where messages are published, to facilitate this. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=167))
- unit of data within Kafka is called a message. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=209))
- message can have an optional bit of metadata, which is referred to as a key. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=212))
- Keys are used when messages are to be written to partitions in a more controlled manner. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=213))
- batch is just a collection of messages, all of which are being produced to the same topic and partition. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=217))
- messages are opaque byte arrays to Kafka itself, it is recommended that additional structure, or schema, be imposed on the message content so that it can be easily understood. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=223))
- that do not require code to be generated when they change; ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=229))
    - Note: How?
- Messages in Kafka are categorized into topics. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=238))
- Topics are additionally broken down into a number of partitions. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=239))
- represents a single stream of data moving from the producers to the consumers. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=248))
- Kafka clients are users of the system, and there are two basic types: producers and consumers. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=254))
- Kafka Connect API for data integration and Kafka Streams for stream processing. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=255))
- Producers create new messages. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=257))
- single Kafka server is called a broker. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=282))
- broker receives messages from producers, assigns offsets to them, and commits the messages to storage on disk. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0758ZYVVN&location=282))
