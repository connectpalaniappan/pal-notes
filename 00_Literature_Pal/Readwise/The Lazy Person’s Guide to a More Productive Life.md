## Highlights
- I kind of pride myself on somehow being kinda lazy, but still having most of my shit together. And I think it’s just the ability to be productive and organized, and prioritizing self care. But, yes, also being a childless Millennial helps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvk0b3qv4vwq6e6t98f3f14))
    - Note: [[Productive]] and [[organized]] can exist together even when you are lazy
- even if you do have kids, or not, or whatever, I think there are times you can make your life feel a bit more productive even if you only have a short window to do so. You may feel like you’re working all the time but still not getting anything done.
  And honestly, it doesn’t have to be that way. A few simple changes can help you achieve more in less time without working harder. So let’s dive into my lazy person’s guide to a more productive life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvk31pkw162w3p01f79e8wq))
    - Note: Simple changes will transform your life. Well said.
      Even recently just putting the dishes directly into the dish washer is a huge victory.
- First and foremost, you have to decide what’s a priority. By wasting time on smaller tasks, or ones that don’t really move the needle, you’ll be doing more work with fewer results in life.
  When you focus on the most important goals, you’ll automatically feel more productive. And once that goal has finally been achieved, you’ll feel like a million bucks. You’ll feel more accomplished, and honestly, you may start the snowball effect where you get on a roll. And then you can go back to being lazy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvk675x7eyg1dd7a4q6wpzm))
    - Note: Pick only the top 2 out of 10 [[goals]] each for life and work that would give you the highest benefits I e. 80 percent more win compared to the others.
- If large projects feel too overwhelming making you lazy and not productive, then break them into smaller tasks. By breaking a large project down into smaller more manageable tasks you’ll feel more confident in knocking them out. And again, after you knock off one thing from your to-do list, you’re more inclined to knock another out, and so ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvkedyh2eq8q9w51g1mswyn))
    - Note: Knock off by breaking the tasks into smaller ones
- do this a lot with [my Asana tasks](https://anindigoday.com/how-to-use-asana/). If I have a big project I need to work on, I am bound to be overwhelmed by it and just avoid it all. Instead, I break the project into small tasks and assign them to myself to knock out. And without fail, every time, I end up getting through MANY of the smaller tasks making my way through these projects more easily ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvm1pxa39e42fawdpke8ksd))
    - Note: Break it down into smaller tasks can be done easily with todoist. That's the power of todoist.
- If you want to knock out some productivity, you better eliminate the distractions. This may mean putting your phone on Do Not Disturb so you can knock out whatever task is at hand. Or maybe it’s turning off the TV to get some work done. If there are distractions keeping you from your optimal productivity so you can more quickly get things done and embrace your lazy, eliminate them! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvm3933vhk93msm7e4pnnaf))
    - Note: Use journal to identify the distractions
- The key to being lazy and productive? Automate. Whenever possible, automate whatever it is you can. From your bill pay, to subscribing to the things you buy all the time on repeat, to automating meal planning and grocery shopping, and so on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvm40440dfadc7874933nhy))
    - Note: List all tasks in journal that can be automated
- Delegating tasks is key to offloading things from your to-do list. Whether it’s home chores that you offload to your kids or spouse, or start to flex your manager muscles at work and delegate more tasks to your team because you’ve been taking on more than you need to, it’s time to delegate.
  I think some of us (hi, it’s me) tend to be control freaks and want to do all the things. I do this a lot in literally everything and anything I do in life. So this is a good reminder for myself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqvm527fyevm49axcdvapn5v))
    - Note: List tasks that can be delegated in the journal
