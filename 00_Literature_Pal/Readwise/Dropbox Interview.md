  Well, come back to the system design podcast with west and keven. To day, we're going to go back and do a little bit of what we started off the pocas series with, which is a mock interview. We got a request from a listener interested in, you know, listening to another mock interview, so we decided now would be a good time we have you heard about the service drop box?

Sen cer in the pogesenc oge, i'm to stop now. ([Time 0:31:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/777c1d6a-ad82-4a10-89c4-d6fe822297d6))
