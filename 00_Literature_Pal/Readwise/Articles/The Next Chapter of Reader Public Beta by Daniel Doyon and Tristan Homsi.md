summary:: Readwise has announced the public beta of Reader, a fully-integrated reading app that allows users to read anything from web articles to PDFs and EPUBs. The app also offers productivity-oriented features such as first-class highlighting and annotating, keyboard-based reading, text-to-speech, and GPT-3. Reader aims to solve the problem of unbundling digital reading by bringing all types of content in one place. The app is being actively developed with responsive customer support and rapid feedback loops from beta testers.
