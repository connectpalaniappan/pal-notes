> hey everyone welcome so in this video I'm going to be covering two main things first I'm going to be covering obsidian for beginners and then I'm also going to be covering project manage my pro project management system that follows the getting things done methodology and in particular I'm going to be following this obsidian Vault that I've made it's the monu template it's available in my GitHub Link in the comments and so whether you're new to obsidian or whether you're a Die Hard supporter there's probably going to be
> something here for you so let's just get started for those that are new to obsidian what's obsidian why why obsidian now I'm not like sponsored or anything it's a it's free anyways but this is sort of the journey that I've gone through with projects project management and managing task so I first started college undergrad with a paper system just having Post-it notes or uh not cards and each week really just writing down
> um what sort of homeworks and different tasks I had to do on any given day so this was I think probably for an entire week just writing all the tasks and um by the given day and checking them off at the end of the day but if you notice this is very uh you have to have assigned tasks and it all has your your life has to be task to task and that's really all that you're focusing on and so for long-term projects this can be very
> um unyielding is that a word it can be very difficult to use and so the next sort of thing that I gravitated towards was iOS notes this is a slight step up in that I can use my computer I can also use my phone write my notes much more quickly I don't have to erase and rewrite them then after that I started to use an Excel system this is where I'm having multiple sheets for different um areas areas for example one sheet has an
> inbox where I just write down different ideas that I need to organize another sheet has reoccurring tasks so for example daily tests that I always wanted to do weekly tasks um but again it's very bad with projects projects I want to have different documents and they're all living and breathing and if I'm having to search through a bunch of folders and find the right document create a new document it all gets very difficult to manage multiple projects
> and I do have a projects folder uh that I won't show but it's it just you can see that it's sort of all over the place then the next one is notion this is it it's great functionality however it's first not free if you want like a lot of the good features and also it's cloud-based I really want something that's Offline that I can use whenever and that is also secure I have ambitions of lots of startups and different ideas
> and if I know that a notion employee or not saying that this would ever happen but if something like that can happen I don't want it to happen so I'd rather have it on me to secure my own notes and then the next one is also Tod doist this is similar to notion however it's more task oriented um but again it's on it's on cloud-based it's cloudbased online um and then as always it's not not free and
> yeah it again it's also not Project based in particular for using lots of files for projects like I do which I'll cover briefly in the in the next parts so now with now I'm using obsidian suppose you're interested so now how do we get started if you're new to obsidian this is uh essentially what you do when you download obsidian you're going to have an open screen like this
> and you won't see these these are my recent vaults and okay first let's just open it so if you downloaded my uh my template Vault from GitHub you'll see it show up you might have to unzip it first so once you unzip it you'll have the folder open it and this is what you'll see and if it's if it doesn't quite show up on the side like this if anything's
> um spotty then follow these instructions so first you want to toggle this right now it's off we want it on so now you can see the folders are organized as as I intend I intend to I intend them to be and then also open up the obsidian start so let's do that again go to manage workspace layouts load and then it'll open up oh it opens up images but it'll
> open up this main file and this is where you want to start and so if you're well again we're assuming you're unfamiliar but with obsidian everything is folder and file based so a VA is essentially a root folder where all of your other folders and notes are held so this is called the Monroy template Vault and in this vault in this folder we have 151 files and 123
> folders so that's the Vault that's sort of how uh obsidian is structured and so with obsidian we have um all these different sort of UI components to it to make it more than just a bunch of folders and files so there's a right side bar left side bar I don't know if these are the official names but it's what I'm using for now the bottom which
> has more options the top right here and this little side bar so these are all different things you can click on you can customize for more functionality and now in this video I'm not going to cover all of those different aspects what I'm mainly trying to cover is how do you uh get started how do you get rolling you I'm sure you can find other videos that cover all these little buttons my suggestion is just click them and explore maybe find one or two key
> videos that are helpful maybe some people in comments will comment them I'm in particular focused on this fault getting you started with the functionality customizing the functionality and the different settings options so this first part of the Vault for beginners looks at how do we set up obsidian in particular the settings and
> plugins so looking at the options here we can see these are the different options that show up in settings so for example options we look we see we have General editor files appearance hot links core plugins and Community plugins now the other ones core plugins Community plugins are just extensions of these two so this covers all the settings and so just looking at at this first if we go into our settings we go to General doesn't really have anything
> any setting functionality um but if we go to editor this is where you start to see all the different things um and these are different settings you can explore and this tells you a little bit about them you'll notice that the setting also tells you a little bit about what it does and my suggestion is to just download two of these vaults open them side by side click one on on on one side
> leave it as default on the other side and then you can see what changes it it's just so that you understand where everything is if you want to become a very uh very good around obsidan yeah so you can just check that out files and links same thing just a bunch of different settings you can have and and explore
> appearance this is where things start to start to get a lot more customizable in in the sense of your interacting with it daily so for example appearance how do you want it to appear right now I have dark theme you can also have light theme for fonts you can specify that that how you want
> the the different sort of buttons and and your title to appear right now my title's in line so I can type anything it changes the name of the title there's other ways to not have the title show up and then for even more customization we obsidian has um this is where I'm not too familiar but there's it's markdown based and so with that
> there's also a lot of JavaScript and CSS and other things that I'm not too familiar with but I know enough to be able to adjust the headings the text color bold color italics this one and and have this little color for the check mark and all of these different things you can adjust yourself as well so when you download this there's going to be a let me see if I can find the
> folder yeah so when you download this the these are all the files that you're downloading and some of them are hidden for example the obsidian file this is where you have all the different appearance um Community plugins and other things like that and so with this one you're going to see within obsidian there's Snippets in Snippets t
