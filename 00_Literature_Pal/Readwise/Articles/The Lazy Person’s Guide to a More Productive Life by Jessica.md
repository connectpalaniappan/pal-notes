> First and foremost, you have to decide what’s a priority. By wasting time on smaller tasks, or ones that don’t really move the needle, you’ll be doing more work with fewer results in life.

Or maybe it’s turning off the TV to get some work done. If there are distractions keeping you from your optimal productivity so you can more quickly get things done and embrace your lazy, eliminate them!
