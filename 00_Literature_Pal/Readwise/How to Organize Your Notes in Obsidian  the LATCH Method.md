- Summary: Wondering how to organize your notes in Obsidian? In this video, I talk about some methods in Obsidian for imposing structure and organization, the LATCH method for adding data to your data, and which methods I would use in Obsidian for each part of LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy). This is not meant to be a definitive or prescriptive guide for how YOU should organize your notes. Instead, take this as a look into how *I* prefer to do it, in the hopes that you may find inspiration for how you'd like to do it as well.

## Highlights
- The most important thing about taking notes is that you do it. However, the more notes that you have, the more it becomes apparent that some organizational structure probably wouldn't go astray. So, what do you do? Hi, I'm Nicole van der Hoeven and on this channel, I like to talk about tech, travel and taking notes, especially using digital tools like Obsidian. And in this particular video, I'm gonna show you how I organize my notes, just in the hopes of helping you figure out how you might wanna do it.
  When you're deciding where to put notes, what it really boils down to is, how do you want to find this note again? There are a few methods for that, first is folders. Folders are probably the one that we're most familiar with because regardless of your operating system, this is how your computer lets you choose where to store files. Folders are like directories that you can put files into. The problem with folders is that you can't put one file in two different folders.
  It's one or the other. So it forces you to make a decision as to where that note belongs. Most note-taking tools also try to get you to organize things in this way, but I think that folders are best for situations where one note really only belongs in a single folder, or if you're trying to maintain the uniqueness of a note. For example, I have all of my literature notes going into Obsidian, so for example, if I read a book that's called How to Take Smart Notes, let's say, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqnd9eymf9zmxg0abqd1he10))
