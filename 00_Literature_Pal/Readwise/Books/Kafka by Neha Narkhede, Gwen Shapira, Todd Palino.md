> Kafka is a true storage system built to store data for as long as you might like.


### Location 49
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> capabilities in Kafka let you compute derived streams and datasets dynamically off of your streams with far less code.


### Location 52
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> Hadoop lets you store and periodically process file data at a very large scale.


### Location 62
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> power custom applications built to trigger off of these same data streams.


### Location 76
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> message bus for event-driven microservices, stream-processing applications, and large-scale data pipelines.


### Location 167
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> Pub/sub systems often have a broker, a central point where messages are published, to facilitate this.


### Location 209

> unit of data within Kafka is called a message.


### Location 212
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56

### Location 217

> batch is just a collection of messages, all of which are being produced to the same topic and partition.


### Location 223
[[2018-08-31]] 23:56
> messages are opaque byte arrays to Kafka itself, it is recommended that additional structure, or schema, be imposed on the message content so that it can be easily understood.
