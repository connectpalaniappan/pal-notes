- solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=411))
- Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=447))
- affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=453))
- An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=464))
- The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty to many people. We are used to thinking that properties are associated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=468))
- Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=514))
- We need both. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=515))
- natural mappings are cultural or biological, ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=657))
- natural mappings follow from the principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or patterning of controls and feedback. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=658))
- exploit natural mappings. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E257T6C&location=670))
