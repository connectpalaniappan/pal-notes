- characters $()*+.?[\^{| simply matches itself. To ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=652))
- ‹(?i)› turns on case insensitivity for the remainder of the regex, and ‹(?-i)› turns it off for the remainder of the regex. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=707))
- The notation using square brackets is called a character class. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=834))

- A caret (^) negates the character class if you place it immediately after the opening bracket. It makes the character class match any character that is not in the list. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008Y4OP1O&location=858))
