## Highlights
- Robert C. Martin’s definition of the Single Responsibility Principle, which states “Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.” ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=161))
- communication between the services themselves are via network calls, to enforce separation between the services and avoid the perils of tight coupling. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=184))
- there is too much sharing, our consuming services become coupled to our internal representations. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=187))
- The golden rule: can you make a change to a service and deploy it by itself without changing anything else? ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=192))
- perhaps the posts the users make could be stored in a document-oriented data store, ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=205))
- Web, native application, mobile web, tablet app, or wearable device. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=270))
- allow some lifecycle management of the modules, such that they can be deployed into a running process, allowing you to make changes without taking the whole process down. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=329))
- our architects need to shift their thinking away from creating the perfect end product, and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge, and continue to grow as we learn more. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=412))
- Netflix, for example, has mostly standardized on Cassandra as a data-store technology. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=448))
- For your metrics this might be Graphite, and for your health it might be Nagios. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=544))
- Dropwizard and Karyon are two open source, JVM-based microcontainers. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=581))
- you might want to mandate the use of circuit breakers. In that case, you might integrate a circuit breaker library like Hystrix. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=586))
- Dropwizard’s Metrics ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=588))
- Netflix mitigates this by using sidecar services, which communicate locally with a JVM that is using the appropriate libraries. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=598))
- When services are loosely coupled, a change to one service should not require a change to another. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=725))
- loosely coupled service knows as little as it needs to about the services with which it collaborates. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=729))
- We want related behavior to sit together, and unrelated behavior to sit elsewhere. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=733))
- Once you become very proficient, you may decide to skip the step of keeping the bounded context modeled as a module within a more monolithic system, and jump straight for a separate service. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=787))
- Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying to go to microservices from the beginning. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=804))
- When you start to think about the bounded contexts that exist in your organization, you should be thinking not in terms of data that is shared, but about the capabilities those contexts provide the rest of the domain. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=809))
- how do we handle processes that span service boundaries and may be long running? ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=974))
- With orchestration, we rely on a central brain to guide and drive the process, much like the conductor in an orchestra. With choreography, we inform each part of the system of its job, and let it work out the details, like dancers all finding their way and reacting to others around them in a ballet. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=983))
- HTTP caching proxies like Varnish and load balancers like mod_proxy, ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1131))
- WebSockets, ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1239))
- recommend REST in Practice (O’Reilly), ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1247))
- keep your middleware dumb, and keep the smarts in the endpoints. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1265))
- ATOM is a REST-compliant specification that defines semantics (among other things) for publishing feeds of resources. ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1267))
- Enterprise Integration Patterns ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1304))
- Reactive extensions, often shortened to Rx, are a mechanism to compose the results of multiple calls together and run operations on them. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1319))
- don’t violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across all services. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1345))
- implementing a reader able to ignore changes we don’t care about — is what Martin Fowler calls a Tolerant Reader. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1422))

- A great place to start is to use a tool like the freely available SchemaSpy, which can generate graphical representations of the relationships between tables. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1797))
- easier to push out changes to configuration files than alter live database tables. ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1843))

- Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain. In many ways, having an existing codebase you want to decompose into microservices is much easier than trying to go to microservices from the beginning. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=804))
- When you start to think about the bounded contexts that exist in your organization, you should be thinking not in terms of data that is shared, but about the capabilities those contexts provide the rest of the domain. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=809))
- how do we handle processes that span service boundaries and may be long running? ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=974))
- With orchestration, we rely on a central brain to guide and drive the process, much like the conductor in an orchestra. With choreography, we inform each part of the system of its job, and let it work out the details, like dancers all finding their way and reacting to others around them in a ballet.

- don’t violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across all services. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1345))
- implementing a reader able to ignore changes we don’t care about — is what Martin Fowler calls a Tolerant Reader. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1422))
- Postel’s Law (otherwise known as the robustness principle), which states: “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.” ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1430))

- A great place to start is to use a tool like the freely available SchemaSpy, which can generate graphical representations of the relationships between tables. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1797))
- easier to push out changes to configuration files than alter live database tables. ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1843))

- For a more detailed discussion of the subject, you may want to take a look at Refactoring Databases by Scott J. Ambler and Pramod J. Sadalage (Addison-Wesley). ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=1878))
- we’ll want to monitor the host itself. CPU, memory — all of these things are useful. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=3212))
- monitoring the response time of the service is a good idea. ([Location 3217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00T3N7XB4&location=3217))
