## Highlights
- Response time is the amount of time it takes for the system to process a request from the outside. This may be a UI action, such as pressing a button, or a server API call. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=537))
- Responsiveness is about how quickly the system acknowledges a request as opposed to processing it. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=539))
- Latency is the minimum time required to get any form of response, even if the work to be done is nonexistent. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=543))
- Throughput is how much stuff you can do in a given amount of time. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=547))
- Load sensitivity is an expression of how the response time varies with the load. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=556))
- Efficiency is performance divided by resources. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=559))
- The capacity of a system is an ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=560))
- indication of maximum effective throughput or load. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=561))
- When building enterprise systems, it often makes sense to build for hardware scalability rather than capacity or even efficiency. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=571))
- The more pure HTML you can go, the easier life is. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=792))
- favor of the Web presentation ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=797))
- all on the server is the best choice for ease of maintenance. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=799))
- Splitting across both the desktop and the server sounds like the worst of both worlds because you don’t know where any piece of logic may be. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=805))
- Don’t try to separate the layers into discrete processes unless you absolutely have to. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=810))
- complexity boosters—distribution, explicit multithreading, paradigm chasms (such as object/relational), multiplatform development, and extreme performance requirements (such as more than 100 transactions per second).

- strategy object creates the results. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=860))
- As well as providing a clear API, the Service Layer (133) is also a good spot to place such things as transaction control and security. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=935))
- Unit of Work (184) is as an object that acts as the controller of the database mapping. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=1097))
- keep a record of every row you read in an Identity Map ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=1102))

- databases are optimized to handle up to three or four joins per query. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=1137))
- A Transaction Script organizes all this logic primarily as a single procedure, making calls directly to the database or through a thin database wrapper. ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=2324))
- Where you put the Transaction Script will depend on how you organize your layers. ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=2332))
- Domain Model (116) will give you many more options in structuring the code, increasing readability and decreasing duplication. ([Location 2352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=2352))
