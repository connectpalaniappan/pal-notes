## Highlights
- HAProxy uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture to receive requests from clients and ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M5CAJ2L&location=109))
- dispatch them quickly to backend servers. It does not open a thread and wait for a server to respond. Instead, it moves on to do other work and returns when it receives a callback. This allows it to scale to many thousands of concurrent connections. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M5CAJ2L&location=110))
- based on HTTP headers, cookies and URLs. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M5CAJ2L&location=137))
- In HAProxy, an Access Control List (ACL) is a set of criteria that we try to match incoming requests or responses against. ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M5CAJ2L&location=741))
