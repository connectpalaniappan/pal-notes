summary:: Incidents in software environments are inevitable, and managing them effectively is crucial for maintaining customer trust. Preparation is key, involving defining service ownership, establishing an incident declaration process, and conducting regular drills. Service ownership entails teams taking responsibility for the entire lifecycle of a service, while incident roles and a clear declaration process are essential for efficient incident management. By following best practices like these, companies can streamline their incident response and minimize the impact on customers.
