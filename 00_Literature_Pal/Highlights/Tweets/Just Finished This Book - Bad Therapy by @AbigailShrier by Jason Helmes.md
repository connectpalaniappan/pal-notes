summary:: "Just finished this book - Bad Therapy by @AbigailShrier" is a book that explores why children are facing so many mental health problems despite the resources available to improve mental health outcomes. The book argues that constantly ruminating on emotions and feelings negatively impacts mental health. It also suggests that trying to solve every problem for kids has created a generation that cannot do anything for themselves. The book recommends that families with loving parents that have strict rules for the household produce the happiest, most well-adjusted kids.

> Anxiety, depression, suicide, etc are all higher than they've ever been with kids, even though their lives are arguably better than ever before. It just doesn't make sense.
