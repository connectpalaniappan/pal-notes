> Do you ever feel like you're just floating through   life...but not actually getting closer  to the person that you want to be. It usually happens around New years, you imagine  all the bad habits your going to break free from,   and all the good habits you will begin. “This time it will be different”  you say to yourself. This time I   AM going to do the things that I say I will. Only to end up back where you began shortly  after and no closer to what you had envisaged. So the question is, how do you become the person  you dream of becoming? How do you break free   from bad habits and make the habits  you desire easier and automatic?
> Atomic Habits by James Clear  answers all these questions. We are going to be doing a detailed visual summary  of this book, And dive deep into topics like Habit loops Dopamine spikes  Priming your environment Plus heaps more And make sure to stick around until the  end of the video where we tie everything   together from the video and I go step by  step through how I've personally been using   this book with my own habits and how you  can start applying it to your own habits. I hope this summary inspires you to go out  and grab a copy of the book for yourself   because this book deserves a  space on everyone’s bookshelf! Let’s jump into it
