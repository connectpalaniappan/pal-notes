> then employers match certain percentage and this also varies it may be dollar to dollar 50 cents on a dollar whatever the range is and also to certain percentage some companies do up to 4% 6% as high as 10% so you need to make sure what they do and uh make sure that you match at least to that level if not more

> olo 401K this is mainly for um business owner so business owner in the sense small businesses like individual businesses are with very small number of uh employees like retail shops and those kinds of people they can do that the advantage with this one is basically it's uh non-elective contribution and uh with the elective contribution and non-elective elective is the limit what you say the 22,500 by
> the employee but the employer can contribute more at the end of the year or during the year up to the 25% of the compensation that is being paid suppose uh the limit is 66,000 so there is a really a big amount on this approach if you're doing a business on your own you can save up to 66,000 if you can afford to save that money that means you need to have $330,000 compensation that means that is a 25% limit the AGI limit on the
> non-elective contribution the 22500 is normal and then in addition you can add more money up to 66 and if you are more than 50 still that 7500 ads so total of 73,500 can be put in it's a huge amount of money even if you do for a few years that'll grow like crazy before you start retiring it's a little bit complicated to set up but if you're a single business owner your CPA or atony can help you in trying to set this up

> the spousal Ira this is one subject most of the people may not know there are some families in which one spouse may not be working if they're not working you can still contribute an IRA under his name or her name so this is the same limits the 6500 7500 and
> then the AGI limit is 83k for single Filer and 116k for joint filer so you can do this and take the tax reduction but if even if you're not eligible for tax reduction you can still put in spousal IRA and then you can roll over into Roth IRA and avoid tax later when you take out the money so if if you're not done for your spouse so far even they're not working please consider doing this this is a huge uh saving over the years when it makes to grow

[[2024-04-17]] 22:56
> simple IRA this is for the small companies which are easy to administer you don't need to pay a lot of fee for the administer and then it's a similar setup both employees and employer can contribute it and but the limits are slightly different it's a 15,500 uh for less than 50 years and then additional 3500 for uh over 50 I think it's very uh few companies have

[[2024-04-17]] 22:57
> SEP IRA sepa is like traditional IRA and this is for again small business owners small business owners also should have some choices on the IRA this is one of them and uh the one important thing is only the employer can contribute the employ cannot contribute so if it is a one person business you are the employer and you

> investment vehicles and then use this as a retirement fund even though it looks smaller if you don't use it if this is available with your company make use of it put the money in there in addition some of the employers may also give you bonus on this I know a couple of companies that I I was involved with they used to give a $1,000 bonus if you sign up for HSA plan and that's a free money that is available if you want to include

> will not be $1 to $1 because IRS takes the role over Ira whatever the amount you have on 31st December and PR rate it and apply a discount Factor the discount factor is based on the total amount of money you have in your Ro IRA rollover Ira if you hire the money the discount factor is higher it may be like8 6

> I did the presentation along with two other people going through a lot of details on this one here I'm going to share the basic essential documents that you need to have you need to have the living trust if you don't have it after this webinar go and do one I hope all of you listening in this um webinar have the living trust this is the one fundamental thing that you should do when you're living in United States if you don't have this if you own
> your asset value is more than 100,000 I'm giving a rough number each state has a different number but 100,000 is a good number if your asset value is more than 100,000 I'm 100% sure everyone listening in this meeting have more than 100,000 in asset then you're if you don't have the living trust if someone passes away then the money from your asset will not go to your beneficiaries immediately it will go through probate it's a process
> done by the government and the probate process takes lot of time minimum one year maybe longer and then huge legal expense legal expense can go anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 depending on your estate cost all this is waste and then your beneficiaries kids cannot access your money until the provate is done so to void that one should set up the living trust there are lot of easy ways to set the trust you can uh talk to me
> later or you can text me or you can Google it how to set it up it's much much easier way to set it up so go ahead and do that living trust when you're doing the living trust you need to create three other documents along with that one is the L will and testament the other is Healthcare forani and financial power of a time last will and testament everybody knows what the will is and so you create created and documented in black and white who gets what and then uh get it notorized so
> that becomes your uh will and you can change it and the living trust also makees sure that you do a revocable thrust so you can change it later a few years if you want to change it the power of aani is actually giving the power to somebody when you yourself cannot make the decision either on your health or on the finance suppose one gets really sick and their cognitive senses are not in the right uh condition they cannot make a reasonable decision on health as well
> as Finance what to do with their health can I do the surgery or not can I take this procedure or not they cannot or he or she cannot do it so you need to name somebody that you have 100% confidence who has total interest in you make the right decision on behalf of you that's what the healthcare power of aani the same thing whatever your assets somebody needs to deal with your Finance they will not take anything from your assets but they are only managing it and doing
> on behalf of you that's what it is financial poweron and the last one along with this documents make sure that you have your insurance documents in place so that your beneficiaries understand where the money is and how to get it so this is in addition to the retirement planning that you can keep this together next slide please I think that should be coloss okay this is the key takeaways as we talked about again uh this five step process set the age set

> change all your major assets into the living trust name is really important especially your major assets your homes and your other bank accounts and major assets make sure that you change the title from your individual name or joint name into the name it's very easy to do for example if you want to do it for your home you go to the county record club's office and there is a single form
> you fill it out as like $ 20 $30 fee and they'll change the title name to your trust me so it's very easy to do things so make sure that you same thing with the bank they all they need is the trust certificate so once you set up the trust you can download and print the trust certificate and take the trust certificate and change all your bank account deposits and all those things under the trust name so that's number one and there is another important thing that I came to know because I did my trust in
> 94 later I adjusted and revised the test trust about five years ago at that time that atani gave me a great idea there is another paper that you attach to the trust which we there is a statement that you can add there that say that anything that I inadvertently missed in under my name


### id708212158

> you do that then it is automatically covered so that's a great I've been giving that paper to so many people in the last year do this and add to that paper that makes it easier for you wow that's pretty good that's actually a lazy way out but I mean is better you don't want to go into litigation right yeah yeah that's true that's true so on the same note right because I think one thing that the some of the attorneys advis is you know you can transfer the broke the accounts like 401K not 401K but you know
> the bank accounts those type of things but then would you really just transfer the the bank account the checking account into the trust you probably yeah see it's up to you if you want to do it religiously you can do everything but there is a slight leeway I mean it used to be like uh 50,000 but noway is 100,000 under the limit of 100,000 the combined stuff checking account you don't keep a lot of money so it doesn't really matter so checking account you can leave it but the
> checking account there is a it's called po you can add one of your kid as a PO in the checking account so they're easily accessible to them if you pass away so that they can access the more than the checking account the checking account is linked to your save deposit boxes so the save deposit access is based on the checking account that's the reason why they do it but you don't need to if you have a small amounts there like your uh checking account you don't need to okay and the Pod is what does POD stand for person of death some point

> you should Target every year for retirement savings and Target funds do it safely yeah the safe method I mean uh on an average S&P 500 comes to
> around 7% or 7 and a half% so if you try to do it usually when you do the calculation what the number they use is between five to six the insurance companies use that 5 to 6% number in fact there is a state mandated uh illustration example they tried to change it every year last year it was 5.97 and at this time they trying to do a 6.1 or 6.2 that's the range that you're supposed to look for in an average saving so that is a compounding
> growth that you're looking for in some years you may be higher some years you lower yeah okay got it it seems like you beat that 7% handily with your based on the returns

> don't have any rollover Ira you can say no if you have a roll over Ira you can put yes they will send you the document and take it to your CPA he will calculate the discount Factor how much discount okay so I think there was another question on the rollover Ira so basically if you have a rollover Ira or a regular IRA account

> number one as explained it's going to be discounted if you don't do anything it'll be discounted so at some point it may not be worth doing it the other option is from the rollover Ira you can move it back into your employer 401K you are still working if you do that then you're making the Slate clean

> revocable versus irrevocable correct revocable is the one that you can keep changing if you change your mind they change your mind in the sense I didn't go detail with the living trust in the living trust there are a lot of things you set it up you set up your trustees when you pass away who's going to take care of it so you name two people there and maybe five years later you change your mind and you can change the trustee

> state planning in the Southern California NSA region and nurn region and after that session few few of the youngsters have gone and set up the living trust one option called Susi Arman if you type Susi Arman on the Google it'll give you the Susi Arman living person it's like $89 or $100 or something like that it's everything is there all all you have to do is fill in the blanks your name and what you want to do it will spit out all the documents all the five documents that we talked
> about you just take the document and go to a notary and sign it you're done your living test is done it'll take less than an hour if you want to do that so that's the most simplest way of doing it but if your uh estate is complex with a lot of things then you need to go to an atony and the Atty can charge anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 depending on the complex or how detail you want to do the living trust is uh we can talk for a day what
> all the other things involved in this there is so many methods you can you can set it up for your kids your grandkids Perpetual there's so many classes and the stepup bases how to change the stepup bases individually one person passes away hundreds of uh details weeds you can add to the living trust but the main focus initially is to set up the basic thing to avoid the probate is just this $89 uh software will help you to do that after that when you get time or
> your estate is complex you go through that another good point I want to bring here is currently the living trust the pro we talked about the estate planning and the taxes the tax limit is currently 12.8 million per person after the inflation adjustment 12.8 million so as a couple you can do 25.6 6 million without the death tax when somebody passes away the estate value but that is sunsetting next year 2025 there are a
> lot of regulations which were put there are going away we don't know what Congress is going to do they may set reset it back to we had 5 million before either can go back to 5 million or go to 3 million if Democrats come they go lower if Republican come and to play they make it higher

> JM if you get inheritance from India what are the tax implications here this is a really uh EPA question it's a good question I can share what it is but it is pretty complicated in legal terms any money
> that you get any income you get you pay tax I have to make the differentiation between income and inheritance so income you have to declare no no matter where which part of the world you have investment your income needs to be declared if you live in United States and pay the federal tax if you pay the tax in that respective country for example India then you can take the credit here and uh you can tell your CPA so you can do the
> pass through so you don't have to pay it here that is on the income but when comes to the inheritance the ini initial inheritance it's not giving you any income so legally you may not be required to pay the tax but if that is giving you some sort of income immediately for example that inheritance comes with the commercial complex where you get uh 10 lakhs per month in uh rental then that needs to be declared here and then you need to pay the income tax here but
> the inheritance you just need to declare if this is uh bank or what do you say then in monetary terms then you need to declare it if it is just an asset you don't need to do anything right now if you're filing and we going into more into tax session um if you're filing the tax today you uh declare your deposit you declare your uh bank account information there are forms in the IRS I think it's 18 1989 or I
> don't know the number form number you need to declare every year but you don't pay any tax but you pay tax as long as you getting income in that uh from the bank there for example you have deposits in the bank and uh you get the TDS deducted in India that means you're already paying the tax here you don't need to pay the tax I think I'm going more in detail but the question what he said is it has to be defined exactly what the inheritance is and based on the
> definition the CPA care can tell you whether you need to pay the tax or not right just to add to that I think you know definitely talk to the CPA on this but keep in mind though there is really no um you know uh gift tax as such in India for a blood relative right so keep that in mind and then just like research along those lines so the itance can be defined as a gift from whoever right then in that case you know there may be very minimal tax implications but yo

> contributions to accounts like HSA and 529 be used for other purposes if unused at any point in the future and uh I think he has a followup um it was okay so let's answer this question okay it's a good question because timely question uh two weeks ago when I was in conquer somebody asked me about this 529 uh interestingly there was a change
> recently in the 529 first let me address the HSA HSA yes it can be used for other purposes there's a lot of uh things there given a really wide range of use you can use it not necessarily for help it's a broad perspective and you can download the brochure that gives you where you can use the money it's it's pretty detailed and uh it can be used for practical uh use every day so that has got much better uh use uh option
> other than the help in the 529 it was earlier restricted only for educational purposes but you can transfer from one sibling to the other sibling or you can use it for yourself as a family member if you want to do it and in some cases it can be extended to grandkids but now recently they have come up with a rule that it can be Tak out and uh used after certain number of years I think it's 5 years or 10 years I actually clipped and
> sent to that person and uh I can if this person can contact me I can send that information so they can distribute it take it over 10 years used for some other purpose not necessarily for 529 so it can be done

> do you suggest consolidating to one brokerage account or keep it as it is and maintain it good question because uh number one as you said again based on the third step or fourth step wice investment and manage the investment it becomes harder
> if you have it in multiple places you don't keep track of them and then the second option is I mean second thing is the investment choices in the companies are very limited if you are a Savvy investor it'll be better to consolidate all of them take to one brokerage you can combine them in one uh rollover Ira put all those things in one place and then you can manage your own investment if you are good enough to pick the right investment vehicles and do if you are
> not you can still do that and park in uh ETFs or uh safe Investments otherwise go to the Target date investment in each company if you have 10 places that you have 401k pick Target date funds so that you don't need to go every time every quarter and make adjustment so depending on how comfortable you feel the investment right but the back door you know I think it'll affect the back door though once you convert back door

> Roth 401k is usually better than General 401k is there a straightforward way to say compare Roth IRA versus traditional
> IRA I mean the stallion points we talked about it number one uh when you take the money it's taxfree number two there is no penalty for taking it out as long as fiveyear withholding is done the dollar first dollar went in five years it needs to be there and you can take it those are the only restrictions in the RW but in the traditional you have lots of restrictions you cannot take it you have to wait until 59.5 otherwise you pay 10% penalty and then after that when you take it you pay
> the full income tax at that time when you're taking it out it could be as high as 30% 35% or depending on your individual AGI at that time so that's the fundamental things the other difference is um it is again based on where and how the money is used uh the Roth has much more Flex ibility compared to traditional IRA and uh the question that a lot of people
> have asked okay I have this money I let us let me uh pay the money and take it out and uh convert it you can do the conversion and pay the tax out but again uh it depending on how you're diligent enough to invest it and make the returns it's very difficult to give a single solution which will V do this way


### id708215023
[[2024-04-18]] 00:29
> convert to Roth can we keep
> adding money to the Roth account no you cannot directly add money into the Roth account because Roth account has only one access door either your eligibility as a Roth provider if your AGI is less that's one door and the second do is our back door those are the only two ways the money can enter into the Rock correct so it depends on income limitation right obviously because if you know in any particular year if your income is below the AGI then you get eligible to contribute

> yes it doesn't really matter what you have where you have you can do this uh as long as you have income going I mean income we talked about putting for kids I I didn't expand on that that's a good uh good question Ganesh you can do it the answer is yes you can do it and you can do it for every everybody as long as they have a proof of income that is the only thing which is required uh except the spousal Ira all the other things you
> can do as long as they have an income for example you have a teenager at your home if you can give him some sort of uh pay for the chores he's doing don't give him the money and put the money in this R Ira that is the best thing you can do for the kid and that can go for grow for 50 years and that can be done so that is allowed uh investment so yes it's a good thing to do don't worry about what you have where you have you can do this back door provided it's a business that you
> run right to pay him a salary or okay all right if both husband and wife are contributing to their own ra theories can we still continue to do so after transferring them to the trust can they be transferred to the trust oh I think the question is not very clear I mean you're not converting into trust you don't need to do IRS have nothing to do with the trust IRAs are individual social security number the trust does not come into the picture
> yeah that's why they called individual retirement account yeah but the answer the other answer is yes you can have one for you back door and you can have one for your wife back door both can be done okay question from har Satan are you eligible for Social Security if you are on a green card and not a citizen yes you are as long as you pay for the Social Security tax during your earning years you are eligible if you have a Social Security
> number you are and then it is eligible means what I'm saying is there are other requirements which are same for everybody you need to work 40 quarters to get the Social Security and the 40 quarters any 40 quarters during your uh working years from between the age 25 and F full retirement age you need to work 40 if you achieve that then you are fully eligible for your Social Security dollars how do they determine the Social Security dollars depending on your
> income what you earned they take the best 40 quarters and then use the best 40 quarters and fix the money so anywhere it could be from like $500 a month to all the way to $4,500 I think the ceiling is around 43 or $4,500 currently based on the current inflation rates so that's how they fix it so that's how the Social Security is determined okay um there is a question
> from ctil wlam um and then does the 25x rule consider the effects of reasonable inflation around 2 to 3% assume it also considers reasonable Market return of 5 to 6% right 25x consider both those things because when I mentioned 25x I completely discounted Social Security I was mentioning that in a quick way when I was talking so the Social Security is the buffer which gives you in the inflation protector and also if
> your inflation is there your rate of return even though we are assuming the average uh 5 to 6% return when we did the 25x in several years you're going to be doing lot better than that so that's going to slightly compensate on the inflation adjustment that you're going to do I mean this country has been well managed on the inflation over the years if you take the history yes there were Pikes of inflation but they know how to tame it down and bring it down not like
> other countries where they let it go uncontrolled so they do that so it's going to be shortterm if it is lasting inflation lasting 10 years plus you may have a problem but if it is within the 5 years uh cycle then uh the changes may not be that high the other buffers that we accounted into it which will help

> every year and any thoughts additional thoughts exactly it is much easier there is no rule that you need to do it but it'll make your life complicated uh if you try to manage it so you open one traditional one rth with any brokerage you like and then keep doing it every year I did with swab and I'm still keeping it with schab I mean you can choose any standard broker that be fine try to keep the life simple as much as I mean we are making it complicated with all this but try to keep it simple as much as possible to in one place yeah
> right and and make sure that this is something that we found out of experience this year make sure that you file form 8606 as part of your tax return part one and part two right and some CPS may not know this

> my personal
> opinion I will not do whole life this is totally personal opinion but different people have different opinion I did it but I did it really for a small amount uh 25 years ago because I didn't know much at that time but today I'm not suggesting to have any of my kids or any people that I know directly I I talk to I do not suggest or advise the reason being is whole life used to be pretty good they used to have the 6 to 7% average uh 20 years ago but over the
> years it has become really less attractive currently the average is around 4% plus or minus so you don't want to lock that much money in the whole life and not getting your rate of return your rate of return is lot better in lot of other vehicles compared to whole life because you're contributing throughout your life and you park that money in a different place and invest wisely you get a better return purely on the return basis but if you're not sure of how to manage how to do those all
> those things still it is not a bad idea to have a whole life at least certain par

> consider a custodian account I don't know the probably they need to Define what is custodian account custodian account covers about 100 different things what is the custodian account I think he is referring to if I
> can take a guess the utma account account correct corre if you want to explain that custodian account you can do an utma I did it uh this is again another mistake I did I shared this in a usually I share it with the education estate planning sessions uh when I was trying to uh save money for colleges for my kids I had no clue about 529 existed at that time this I'm talking in 1990s when I came to this country and uh so what I did was okay
> I'll start Talk account for each kid and I started the utma this is exactly uh uniform trusted miners account I think it is custodian account the account will be in my name but I'll have my kids name into it and I will be putting money and operating and doing everything but but the kid can get the benefit if something happens to me the kids automatically take over and that'll be hermany and that's what I did for colleges and uh
> now they're all majors it's all converted into their name so that is one way of doing custodian account I hope that's the question but if it is some other custodian we can talk about there's different types of custodian for the living trust there is a different custodian thing and each Financial stuff have a different meaning as a custodian

> custodian account right I think that can be done up to the limit of the gift gift taxes right every year correct you can do that gift taxes limit every that's true right and the gift tax limit on is uh 18,000 18,000 now 18,000 per person so is it together 36,000 per year correct okay the husband and wife together can contribute 36,000 to the kids custodian account right corre but
> make sure it's allocated right because if you're saving 529 that will count as well so you just put the money in 529 and the custodian utma for investing in stocks and bonds sure but the 529 is preferred because earnings go grow tax free right corre um and um so think I have added name of the beneficiary in different accounts like 401K life insurance Etc and I have some joint Investments with spouse how powerful legally effective

> right beneficiary spouse gets some money quickly it's a good question it's a little complicated but it is a really great question general advice is all your uh retirement accounts keep the beneficiary directly don't put your trust as the beneficiary keep your uh kids or spouse whatever way you want to
> put they usually give you a primary and secondary so general terms is you have your uh spouse as a primary 100% And if your spouse is also not there then you go to uh the secondary and uh however way you want to distribute among the kids you can distribute or you can B name benef any beneficiary

> he cheapest and the best of option is to take umbrella Insurance umbrella Insurance means you can take
> for 3 million 5 million the 5 million if you take it may be like 1500 to 2,000 a year it's not that expensive overall if you look at overall picture but it protects you from lot of unexpected suppose you are in a car accident and uh usually the accident uh coverage you have is a minimum option is insurance company Cote but some insurance companies do 100,000 300,000 but some accident May cost you a ton of money so if you have a deep pocket they
> can go after your wealth so to protect all those things the best option is to take an umbrella insurance which is cheap and it covers a lot of money and people as soon as they know the umbrella insurance they go only for that limit they don't go after your wealth at all that is another Advantage okay good so um so let's just kind of like maybe take two more questions and then wrap up and then you know I can share the additional questions with you and then um so is
> there a benefit to is there a good option is it a good option to move a rollover Ira into a no fee structured annuity to make the back door Roth clean so meaning like you know if you move that back if you move that rollover Ira into an annuity uh you your rollover IRA you don't have an IRA your IRA is zero now so the question is will it make it clean so that you can contribute for you know the 6,500 or 78,000 and then get the
> most of it as and high level answer is yes but you need to make sure you check with your CPA in your tax situation and uh make sure it is done I think under regular IRS code yes they say that if you don't have the role over IR then you get dollar to dollar qualification but there are some subclasses in qualification make sure that this is not in there to my knowledge it is not in there you can convert it so that you get out of the rollover Ira existence at all there is no role over Ira that you need
> to report to IRS anties are not reported to IRS so that way you can do dollar to dollar but to be 100% sure talk to the CPA before you do the conversion okay so tin you have anything so um I think the you know some of the questions are more financial advisor type questions on stocks and bonds and what to do with the Nvidia stock and all that right so maybe we shouldn't address those questions here but these two questions seem to be
> relevant um you know obviously nedia stock would be like 40% of somebody's portfolio today right what to do with it there are many answers to it right so I don't think we should answer that um on Social Security is there any advantage to delay withdrawing after the age of 70 great question I did touch upon this but maybe since I was uh rushing through so much information that may not have been captured well uh let's go back and look
> at it uh maybe we take an example which makes it easier uh suppose I retire on uh 65 at the age of 65 or currently take the 67 now I try to estimate my life expectancy and say it is 87 there are calculators available but standard average is like as I shared 84 for male and 87 for female in us but if your health is better than standard you may be more years or it may be less this is purely based on health unexpected things

> happen in life which is not accounted in this calculation on a standard case you live that much so you can calculate per month what you're getting and then try to do for 20 years you don't need to really do there are calculators available on online you plug in the numbers that tells you exactly what the right number is so I'm giving the background how it is done so you know x amount of dollarss you're going to take out of Social Security start from the day one when you reach the F you apply for a social security
> they'll be happy to give you that is 100% of your Social Security wages back they give it to you but if you start delaying instead of 67 you take on 68 if I'm getting 4,000 at the age of 67 if I go to 68 they give you 8% more that means $320 more my 4,000 will become 4320 assuming there is no inflation so they'll become 4,320 and then another one year delay
> then you calculate 8% of 4,300 then you get maybe like 4700 at the age of 69 then you can delay one more year up to the age of 70 you can delay it so another 8% to so now you talking about 5,100 or whatever the number so that will be the dollar that you'll be getting for the remaining 17 years of your life because you didn't take three years so you ca
