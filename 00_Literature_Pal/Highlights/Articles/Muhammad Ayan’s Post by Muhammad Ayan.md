> (Save this post for later use):
> Creating presentations used to take me hours but with [Decktopus AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/decktopus?trk=public_post-text), all of that changed. Here’s how I created a presentation on "The Future of AI in Education" in just a few minutes:
> 1. Start with your topic
> I typed in my presentation topic: "The Future of AI in Education". Decktopus AI asked me to choose a presentation category (I selected Educational) and gave me the option to upload any documents I wanted to reference or skip that step.
> 2. Let AI suggest an outline
> Decktopus AI created an outline with sections like "AI Revolution," "Education Landscape," and more. It was well-structured and customizable, eliminating any stress over the flow!
> 3. Use PDF import for detailed contentI
> You can upload a PDF with data, and Decktopus will turn into slides. This feature is a game changer if you’re dealing with detailed reports or technical documents.
> 4. Pick your design
> Design is usually the hardest part, but not with Decktopus. I chose a sleek, minimal template that fit my topic. They have options like minimal, dark, or elegant, and you can switch templates anytime if you change your mind.
> 5. Wait a minute for AI to generate the slides
> After selecting my design, I waited just a few minutes for Decktopus to generate the slides. During this time, final adjustments were made to ensure everything looked perfect.
> 6. Review and tweak
> After finalizing the presentation, I made some quick edits by adjusting text and rearranging sections. It's all drag-and-drop, making customization easy without design skills.
> 7. Optional voiceover for more engagement
> I had the option to add a voiceover to the presentation, which is great for adding a personal touch. This feature is perfect if you want to narrate your slides, especially for tech or educational content.
> 8. Final result
> In just a few clicks, I had a professional, polished presentation. Decktopus AI handled all the heavy lifting, and the presentation was ready to go 
> I hope you have found this tool super helpful
