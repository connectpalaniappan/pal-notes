summary:: Uber Eats faced issues with their PayTM payment integration, leading to multiple failed transactions for customers. A new response from PayTM caused confusion, resulting in users being charged multiple times. Ultimately, Uber had to pause the PayTM service to fix the problem and improve communication with their payment provider.

> payments feeling open versus failing closed this means what happens when you encounter something unexpected failing close means you shut down as soon as you see a message that you're not expecting or you see an exception or something does not look right you just don't do anything so what this would have meant if we failed closes is we just cancel the transaction

- [n] fail closed: on errors, donâ€™t proceed. Cancel the transaction.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7wdn86wkhjvvrwjjw1qtsh4)
