> Welcome to module one of the Google Cloud Computing Foundations course: So, what’s the cloud anyway? After completing this first module, you should be able to identify what the cloud is and the effect it’s had on both technology and business. This means that you’ll: Explore cloud computing. Compare and contrast physical, virtual, and cloud architectures. Differentiate infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
> Be introduced to Google Cloud compute, storage, big data, and ML services. And examine the Google network and how it powers cloud computing. The module begins with a definition of cloud computing, followed by a comparison between cloud and traditional architecture, then you’ll examine IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, and finally, you’ll explore the Google Cloud architecture. The module concludes with a short quiz and a recap of the topics covered.
