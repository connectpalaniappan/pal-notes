> grunting and Tennis is one thing but grunting and pickle ball is crazy so the reason why you can hear me grunting so well is because I'm wearing this mic right here that's right next to my mouth so you can literally hear all my breath so why am I or other athletes grunting in pickleball aren't we just hitting a little plastic ball when we're hitting a little plastic ball we're not just hitting with our arms but we're actually using our whole body weight behind it and we put our whole body weight behind it we're using a lot more force and a lot of times this will require extra breath work similar when you hear
> Fighters they make sounds when they punch they're putting their body weight behind their Force they're not hitting anything they're not moving any weights but when you put your body weight behind something you end up having a grunt
