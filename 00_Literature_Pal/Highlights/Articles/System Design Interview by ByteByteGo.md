summary:: System design interview questions are challenging and require the interviewee to design an architecture for a software system. These questions are often vague and open-ended, without a standard or correct answer. Companies use system design interviews to evaluate a candidate's communication and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to analyze and solve complex problems. This course aims to provide a reliable strategy for approaching system design questions and offers knowledge on building scalable systems. It also provides a step-by-step framework and examples to help candidates practice and prepare for system design interviews.
