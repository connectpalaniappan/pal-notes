> you know when the first time you played pickleball and you were like so pumped about it and they're you're out there and you're having fun all of a sudden there was all this terminology being thrown out but you had no idea what people were saying but you were like this is so fun I don't even care yeah then you left and you're like what was that thing they called it the ATC what was that thing you don't even know right and so what I'm about to teach in this video is the seven shots that every pickleball beginner must know because if you want to be in the conversation with people and you want to start to speak the lingo and also just know like what are the different shots in pickleball these are the seven shots that's what this video is about and I'm gonna teach
> you those seven shots and give you one tip to improve those seven shots over the course of this video are you ready let's go all right so welcome back everybody my name is Kyle this is my buddy Danny he's helping me out I hired him hit him a thousand bucks to be here found him on Craigslist I was looking for a beginner pickleball player he showed up in my house he's a lot he's a lot okay I'm just kidding he's my buddy and so um but I'm I'm I'm I'm panicking right now I go buy that pickleball guy people call me that actually this is the name I gave myself but I'm on a journey to be a
> professional pickleball player and I also make educational content for beginner pickleball players to help them improve of the game here we go shot number one is called the serve okay so here's the serve boom all right serve has to go across courts if I hit the serve down the same side that does not count if I hit the serve and it either hits the opposite kitchen line or it lands inside the opposite kitchen line that would not count all right so the serve must land
> beyond the opposite kitchen line on the opposite side that's the rule so the first thing the thing about singles in serve is one to get it in of course and then number two is to try to hit it deep in the court beautiful um I can't tell if that was in or out we'll let you decide nope one of the worst things that you can do is hit a serve short or hit it into the net or hit it long and the main reason is you're just not giving yourself a chance to even win the point it's a it's a giveaway all right and we're not doing a
> giveaway contest in this video and we definitely don't want to be doing a giveaway contest on our serve so that's our first shot all right here's the second one it's the return we're gonna race to the Baseline three two one go all right on the return there's a couple things you want to think about number one the deeper that you hit the return the better and part of the reason is you want your opponents to have a more difficult third shot right the first shots the serve the second shot's the return in their third shot is is what you want to create some difficulty with okay and so the farther you hit it back
> the more difficulty it creates because they're farther from the net they have to there's just a higher probability of error if you hit a really really short return then it's going to be an easier third shot for them now of course the most important thing is get the return in like we talked about with the serve but then the second part is hitting it deep boom hit it deep and you get to the kitchen the most important thing after getting your return in is to get to the kitchen line quickly so ball gets hit to me I'm gonna hit my ball and I'm gonna
> run to the kitchen line and I'm gonna be ready to play the next point so that's the second shot here's the third shot the third shot is in pickleball it's called a drive and essentially a drive is just hitting the ball hard so a drive is this right I hit a ball Danny hits it to me right and I try to hit it hard all right a drive is essentially me just hitting it hard here's the tip the one tip for how to hit a better drive and it's a little bit different if you play tennis a lot of similarities a couple differences and one of the differences is this ball is like a wiffle ball it
> does not actually bounce that high so in tennis a lot of times what happens is the ball will bounce really high so you can start low and you can kind of rise up this is where my tennis friends tell me you can rise up to hit it whereas in pickleball because the ball is so low if you stand tall it's going to be a lot harder to generate the same amount of Top Spin and a lot of times that ball is just gonna it's gonna soar out so what you want to do is you want to actually be pretty low and what I learned as a younger player in tennis is I'm actually going to do a motion where I turn my body and I close my stance a bit and I swing through the
> ball so it's gonna look a little bit like this I'm down closed stance swing through the ball oop let's go again I'm down close stance swing through the ball my friend James ignatowicz who's one of the best singles players in the world he told me that when you go to hit your shot stay down so start down stay down close stance and finish but start down stay down close stance and finish and look at that I almost just took Danny's head off here's the fourth shot you must
> know it's the drop shot and a lot of times the term that you will hear is a third shot drop because it's the most common drop shot that you'll hit you'll serve it it could serve it as this first shot return is the second shot and then the third shot is the third shot drop I just recently made a video that you can see right here or maybe it's right here that uh talks about one of the biggest mistakes that beginner players make and I believe it's actually driving the ball too much which was the last shot I taught and instead they should actually hit a drop more often all right so here's the drop the drop essentially is that you serve it ball comes back and I
> want to drop it so it lands right into this kitchen area that's considered a drop now what's the technique for a drop tennis players come in the first thing they do is they swing really big all the time and even when they're attempting to hit drops they're dropping it with a close stance hitting it kind of high and that's possible but what I would recommend beginners do is they imagine in fact Danny is one of the best cornhole players I've ever seen that guy's won me a lot of money in cornhole yeah and it's actually you do more of a corn hole toss method right so it's not
> a ton of wrist but instead it's like a push it's like a toss with a corn hole okay so the shots the drop the technique is the cornhole method boom and how you're seeing us hit these shots right now is the exact same way that you could work on it back at home hey Danny welcome back hey it's good to have you here yeah okay November yeah all right so here's the here's the fifth one the fifth one is an interesting term it's actually called a dink it rhymes
> with sink it rhymes with holy cow it's not it does not rhyme with holy Castle okay it rhymes with blink so here's the next shot's Dink and this is actually is the the higher levels you get into the more you'll see dings taking place really at beginner levels everyone's trying to hit the ball so dang hard all the time you don't even see a lot of dinking taking place but if you want to actually Excel past a lot of the players that you're playing with right now slowing the game down and dinking is one of the quickest ways to win more games because you'll make fewer
> mistakes and you'll really just extend points and they'll make more mistakes and you're going to win more all right so here's what dinking is right so Danny's right across from me dinking is actually this a very similar method I would suggest for you all as the cornhole method right it's not a big swing a lot of times I'll you see a lot of beginners taking these big swings when the ball is super low nothing good is coming from that except you're either going to hit somebody in the face hit the ball out or hit them into the net no option that I would like right so I'm
> here I'm gonna hit up so my forehand is going to be a shovel method I'm staying strong at the kitchen line h
