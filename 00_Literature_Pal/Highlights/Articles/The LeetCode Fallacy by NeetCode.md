summary:: The text emphasizes the importance of improving problem-solving skills for coding interviews rather than just memorizing solutions. It suggests focusing on core algorithms like DFS and binary search, as well as developing pattern recognition skills. The author advises against memorizing solutions for every problem and instead recommends understanding core algorithms and applying them to specific problems. The text also mentions that exposure to different types of problems, like the longest common subsequence, can help improve problem-solving abilities. Ultimately, the key to success in coding interviews lies in developing strong problem-solving skills through practice and understanding fundamental algorithms.

> ore algorithms needed it's fine to look at Solutions you're in the learning phase just like an ml model you're taking in training data after that you should try to apply your knowledge if you were able to derive the solution to all these problems by yourself

- [n] first look at the solutions during the learning phase, then try to derive the solution during the next phase  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsxc2c6azxc7wpr9eg8v4w3h)
