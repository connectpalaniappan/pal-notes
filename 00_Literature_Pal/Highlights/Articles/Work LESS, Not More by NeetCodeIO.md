> the worst use of time is pretending to do work I consider myself a hard worker because I'm willing to work on the weekend to make sure something gets done that's like my mentality and it's the worst mentality because that meant that while I was actually at work I wasn't focused as much as I would have been if you think you're putting in 60 hours a week you think that's good for you you might want to reconsider you have to think about what you're actually getting done in those hours I would procrastinate so much I'd be on my phone I'd be doing like low priority things
> another example is when I did the 24-hour elak code stream I can pretend like I'm the alpha male I worked 24 hours in a row but the reality is I didn't get that much done I could have sat down for 6 hours hard focused and got the same amount of work done as I did in that 24-hour stream I think honestly focusing on getting as much work done as possible trying to be more productive rather than working longer is so much smarter
