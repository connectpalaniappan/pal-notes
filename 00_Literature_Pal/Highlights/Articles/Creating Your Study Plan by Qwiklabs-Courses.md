> One of the primary goals for this course is to help you devise a study strategy that focuses on the areas you need to work on. Let’s quickly explore how the course is set up. The course and the workbook focus on each section of the exam guide sequentially. To help you craft a study strategy, you’ll take diagnostic questions as part of each module. Many of these questions relate to our Cymbal Direct scenario and ask you to apply concepts you will need to be familiar with as a Professional Cloud Architect. Remember that these diagnostic questions are meant to help you identify gaps in your knowledge,
> but they don’t represent all possible topics on the exam. Remember that we don’t expect you to answer all these questions correctly right now. This is meant to be a course that you take toward the beginning of your Professional Cloud Architect journey, and many of you might not be networking experts yet. After you individually answer the diagnostic questions in each module, you will review the questions and the correct answers to identify what you need to study and where you can find
> more information. As you review the questions, there are hints with bolded text about what is important in the question and how you might evaluate the responses. Remember these tips for multiple choice questions: Read the question stem carefully. Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking. Try to anticipate the correct answer before looking at the options. You should be able to come up with the correct answer just from reading the question stem. More than one answer might be possible on multiple choice questions.
> Take questions at face value. If certain details are omitted, they are unlikely to contribute to the selection of the best answer. Pay attention to qualifiers ("usually", "all", "never", "none") and key words ("the best", "the least", "except"). We’ll review select questions related to each section objective. As we cover each objective, you’ll learn more about where the key concepts appear in Google Cloud documentation, specific courses and modules, and/or specific skill badges.
> At the end of each section objective, you’ll find a list of related resources. Mark or highlight the specific resources you need in your study plan. The final part of your workbook contains a template to help you identify weekly goals and study activities. We’ll talk more about putting together weekly goals at the end of this course. Now that you know about the overall setup of this course and how to use the workbook,
> let’s get started by exploring section 1 of the exam guide.
