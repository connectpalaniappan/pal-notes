summary:: You say SQL Databases can't scale? | SQL vs NO-SQL | Similarities and Differences | Arpit Bhayani | Techie007

Hello everyone,

Welcome back to the channel. I hope you all are doing great. In this video, I discuss with @AsliEngineering  about the myths of SQL and NO-SQL Databases. We discuss the similarities and differences between the two.

This is part 1 of the podcast. Part 2 will be released soon.

> particular kind of database does it scale it depends that a kind of data base doesn't scale with a particular constraint

> nosql database able to scale it's basically by default sharded and

> SQL databases use B plus tree to store the data yeah not true


### id737393714
[[2024-06-23]] 13:59
> plus 3 is one of the implementation right yeah but you can change the storage engine so by the way you can write your own storage engine within three hours right it's

> MySQL is the engine it may be my ISM engine or it could be the innodb engine right now these two popular implementations they store data in B plus three so tha

> no SQL says hey we don't follow any standardization it depends I can be key value store I can be graph I can be document I can do data warehouse I can be columnar I can be anything right so now what is nosql so if I would if I were to put all the all sorts of databases on a landscape I can see that SQL only accounts were five percent of database but it still rules the industry right

> document DBS are very close to the functionalities that relational databases provide with a bit of change in their modeling layer right even I'm not sure abou

> I'll store everything in Ram I don't
> want to store anything in disk it can be used as a cache and which is how basically red is worked out so now

> database typically comprises of five to six independent abstracted layers so first is how it accepts the query then how it parses the query then how it optimizes the query
> then how it creates an evaluation of that query then how it actually evaluates the query and then how it talks to the underlying storage layer and then the actual storage layer itself ri

> Firebase is using almost Json uh mongodb is Json based but internally
> mongodb is not storing Json it is storing bson it is basically binary form of Json

> database is as performant as its storage layer okay because if you are able to fast read or do fast right because if you are doing let's say a time series DB you need to store it in a certain way so that those kind of queries are very
> optimized right because for time series databases it would be like you need to have a very efficient range based queries right plus there would be millions of data points which means you can do run length encoding and a bunch of comparisons on that so your data structure your on disk data structure would have to be optimized for that right okay this is the first level of Distinction that comes in that the problem that my database would try to solve your underlying structure needs to
> solve that problem really well right but it does not dictate what end user sees because you can write a layer that converts this into something which is usable by by rather which is basically easily consumable by the consumer right right but the storage engine is the most most important layer of the database

- [n] How run length encoding can save the range query time ?  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j169ecvqjb28fqg30mh8jmmx)
