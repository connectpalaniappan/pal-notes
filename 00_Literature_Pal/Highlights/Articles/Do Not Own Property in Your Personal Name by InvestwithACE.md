> 18 million landlords in the US made this huge mistake and I hope you're not one of them they bought a rental property not in a trust not in LLC but in their personal name this dramatically reduces your asset protection and your privacy but the craziest part is that it only costs hundred bucks to form an LLC in one of my favorite states to do at Wyoming and it's so easy you can literally do it in 5 minutes on the Wyoming Secretary of State site I'm not your attorney but my attorney told me that you don't need an attorney just do it yourself if you don't live in the state where you formed your LLC you need something called a registered agent I just Google Wyoming registered agent and use the first one for 25 bucks a year
> and if you already bought a rental and your personal name don't freak out contact your local title company and file a quit claim deed to transfer the rental from your personal name into your newly formed entity
