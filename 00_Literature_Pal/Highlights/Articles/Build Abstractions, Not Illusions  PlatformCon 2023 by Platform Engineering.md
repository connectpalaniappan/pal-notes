summary:: The video discusses the importance of building abstractions in technology to help developers deal with complex systems. However, if an abstraction hides essential details, it can become an illusion, misleading the user. The speaker provides examples of essential concepts in building distributed systems, such as push versus pull, consistency, and batch sizes, while details like API fields and service names matter less. He also discusses the difference between abstractions and compositions and uses car analogies to explain the importance of a good abstraction.

> that is well we can solve anyproblem by introducing another layer ofindirection and that in this case shouldShield us from this complexity
