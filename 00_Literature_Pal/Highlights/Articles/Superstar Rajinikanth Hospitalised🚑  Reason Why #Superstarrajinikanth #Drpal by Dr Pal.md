> Apollo Hospital report says that our beloved T rajin Ganer was admitted in the hospital because of a condition called iotic aneurism Iota is the largest blood vessel in the body when there is chronic stress in the wall of the Iota the wall gets weak leading to a bulge called iotic aneurism and the most important risk factor for this chronic stress is high blood pressure I'm so glad that we were able to identify this problem much earlier if not this weaken wall will weaken more leading to rupture if this blood vessel ruptures the result is catastrophic now a stent has been
> placed in the iota to prevent the rupture if you're less than 40 blood pressure needs to be checked once every 3 years if you're more than 40 blood pressure needs to be checked once a year if the blood pressure is more than 120 over 80 you should decrease your sodium intake to 1500 to 2,000 mg per day I'm really not that much worried about the table salt that we add into our food I'm really worried about the hidden source of salt and sodium in our food especially in pickles puppets and chips
