> hi y'all it is Callen from the browser company and I'm here to talk to you about Arc sync now before we dive into how to set this up how to get started with it on your mobile device and on your desktop let's just talk about what Arc sync is now Arc sync allows you to have your home on the internet Arc everywhere or almost everywhere right now so Arc sync is an encrypted syncing service that allows you to have your folders tabs and spaces across all of your Mac desktop devices all of your
> Windows desktop devices and now all of your iPhones now what does this mean as far as combinations can you just do it on your Mac devices and then just do it on your windows devices absolutely not Arc sync allows you to sync your Mac devices with your windows devices and your windows devices with your Mac devices so you can do desktop to desktop Windows to Apple um you can do windows to iPhone you can do iPhone to to Mac you can do all three or or just two or
> none at all it's super exciting um and I'm really excited to show you how to get this set up on your desktop device we're going to be looking at it on an Apple device um but you can do a similar process on your Windows device and we're going to be looking at it on the arc search app to set up the arc sync from my Apple device on my desktop to my iPhone all right let's get started on my desktop so this is my desktop uh Arc you can see it right here and to get Arc sync turned on on on my desktop device I
> am going to go up to Arc I'm going to click preferences for those of you on Ventura or uh on uh Sonoma you're going to see settings instead of preferences we're going to open up my settings here you're going to see your wonderful Arc uh card I love it and we're going to see sidebar sync right here under the account setting now for those of you who've never turned on Arc sync before you're going to see turn on which is going to be the button for those of us myself included who've turned this on
> before um we're going to see that toggle so to turn it on you're going to Simply either click turn on or in my case click that toggle it's going to think for a moment and now it's thinking I know that sounds so simple but that's it that's all you have to do um if you're doing it between desktop devices you're going to do the same process on all of your desktop devices you can do a similar process on your Windows device if you have questions about the exact steps check out our help center for the windows folks out there but it's that simp simple and now
> everything's sinking so you might be wondering well you've done that on your desktop how about on your mobile so let's take a look at my iPhone so how do we get this set up on Arc search so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to click on Arc search and it's going to open the app now instead of looking at this lovely tab I was looking out earlier today we're going to click into that tab Carousel where you can kind of like switch through any of the tabs that you might have open and we're going to click
> into the bottom left hand corner where you see that little monitor I'm going to click right there and it's going to bring up this little window that says sync with Arc desktop now since I have an arc account on my desktop I'm just going to click sign in with Arc and I'm going to use my password I use password manager everyone should um and I am going to click continue and it's done I'm logged in now I know
> it looks like nothing happened but let's actually click back into that little monitor button at the bottom corner of the app look instead of it asking me to sign in I now have my spaces you can see down here on my desktop that it's the same thing it's all of my tabs all of my folders that I have pinned and it's all of my spaces if we slide through we can see all of my spaces that are on my desktop are also showing up on my mobile app
> and that's it that means that now I have all of my pin tabs all of my folders and all of my spaces on my arc search app on the go and on my desktop now you might be wondering hey you have all of that stuff but what about if you want to put a tab from your mobile device onto your desktop device well that's super easy so let's give it a try so I've been looking at this tab as I said I opened it earlier uh because I'm excited to see this Musical on Broadway and say I want to get tickets so I'm going to open up
> the ticket Tab and it's telich charge and I'm be like I want to do this on my computer I think it's going to be easier if I do it on my computer so instead of going through the whole process on my uh phone I want to pin it to my desktop app to do it later so to do that I'm going to click the little carrot in the bottom right corner now it's going to open up all of those things all these settings and stuff I'm going to click on that little pin right next to telich charge.com and instead of it just
> offering me the ability to favorite it on my app it now shows all of my spaces and all of my pinned folders so for me since this is to buy tickets in my personal life to see a musical I'm going to pin it to my personal and it said pin to personal and for those of you who were sneaking on my desktop you might have just seen that not only did I pin it on my mobile device it also appeared right here on my
> desktop and it also appeared as a pin tab with a little mobile um icon right next to it which reminds me that's for my mobile and now I can click into this telich charge tab on my computer and I can buy the tickets here now you can pin as many tabs as you want from your iPhone to your desktop device if you're on another desktop you can pin tabs and they'll show up on your other desktop device though we don't have that little cute icon for another desktop device and
> you now have Ark everywhere so as simple as that sounds and seems that's all that's how it works so let's remember the point here is that Ark is with you everywhere your home on the Internet is coming with you and now you have it in your pocket on the go in your iPhone on your desktop devices both windows and on Mac so before we end this video I just want to do a little bit of housekeeping with you so for anyone out there who's sort of umed because they're
> an Android User um they want to use ARC search they want to have Arc everywhere well you're in luck we are working on it we're working towards having Arc search on Android and Arc sync on Android and we're actually hiring so anyone who's a developer for Android go check out our jobs board and come join us and help us build Ark on Android and for those of you who've been with us long enough and have used the sidebar sync app or the mobile companion app we're actually getting rid of that because all of your mobile app needs are
> now being met by Arc search so make sure you log in you get Arc search on your iPhone and you start using Arc sync there instead of on that old companion app and that's it um the last thing to say is please share your feedback let us know your thoughts and your feelings you know that we're all building Arc together and the more feedback you share the better the app gets both on your mobile devices and on your desktop devices so thank you so much and looking forward to sharing more features with you soon have a great great rest of your
> day
