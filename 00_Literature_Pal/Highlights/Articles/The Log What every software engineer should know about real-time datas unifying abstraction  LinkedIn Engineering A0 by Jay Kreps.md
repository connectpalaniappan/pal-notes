summary:: Logs are a critical component of distributed data systems and real-time application architectures. They record what happened and when, and understanding them is essential for understanding databases, replication, version control, and other software systems. In addition to their use in databases, logs can be used for data integration, real-time processing, and system building. They can handle data consistency, replication, provide commit semantics, and are ideal for supporting messaging, data flow, and stream processing. A log-centric architecture can simplify system design and enable real-time multi-subscriber data feeds.

> I joined LinkedIn about six years ago at a particularly interesting time. We were just beginning to run up against the limits of our monolithic, centralized database and needed to start the transition to a portfolio of specialized distributed systems. This has been an interesting experience: we built, deployed, and run to this day a distributed graph database, a distributed search backend, a Hadoop installation, and a first and second generation key-value store.
