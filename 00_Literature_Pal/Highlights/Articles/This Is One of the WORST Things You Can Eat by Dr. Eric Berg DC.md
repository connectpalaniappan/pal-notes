summary:: The worst food for your liver is seed oils, particularly corn oil, due to their inflammatory and damaging effects. Consuming Omega-3 fatty acids like fish oils can help protect your liver. Avoid seed oils, prioritize healthy fats, and include liver-friendly foods like cruciferous vegetables in your diet.

> number one remove the seed oils from the diet start reading ingredients number two start adding in more omega-3 fatty acids number three start decreasing the amount of animal foods like chicken
