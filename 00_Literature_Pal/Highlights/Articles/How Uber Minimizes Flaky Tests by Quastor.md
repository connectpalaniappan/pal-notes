summary:: Uber created Testopedia to manage and minimize flaky tests, ensuring their thousands of tests are reliable and performant for each code diff. Testopedia analyzes test statistics, categorizes tests, and uses a sliding window algorithm to identify and treat flaky tests efficiently. Uber's system also allows for critical tests, test switches, and non-blocking modes to handle flaky tests without impacting code test coverage.
