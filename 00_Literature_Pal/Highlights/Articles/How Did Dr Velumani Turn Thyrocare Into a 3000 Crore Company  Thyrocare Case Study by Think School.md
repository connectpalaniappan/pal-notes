summary:: Dr. Velumani grew Thyrocare into a successful company by focusing on preventive care tests like diabetes and thyroid, rather than disease tests. By offering a select range of high-profit tests and optimizing logistics, Thyrocare achieved economies of scale and better pricing for customers while giving franchise owners higher commissions. Thyrocare's strategic targeting and service offerings set it apart from competitors and led to its success in the diagnostic market.

> Dr whalmani turned thyrocare into such a legend that it went on to compete with a 6000 crore company like SRA Diagnostics and an 18 000 crore company like Dr lalpath labs and if you look at this chart when thyrocare went IPO Dr lalpath Labs ebitda margin stood at 28 srl Diagnostics stood at 18 whereas thyrocare stood at an ebitda margin of 47 now for any company with a revenue of 1000 crores 47 ebitda is a spectacular

> there is a big big difference in the Radiology business The Operators have to install dynastic equipments very close to the
> patient so if you want to get a test done for a patient in Pune you can't have the MRI machine in Mumbai but if you look at pathology tests you just need sample collection centers and from there onwards these samples can be sent to a central testing unit for analysis so Radiology tests cannot be centralized or be scaled up whereas pathology tests can be scaled up this is the reason why thyrocare focused specifically on pathology tests

> Dr whalmani specifically chose biochemistry tests only again the question is why well this is because of two reasons firstly the blood samples for biochemistry testing remain stable over different temperatures and for long durations this made these samples very conducive for long distance transportation secondly biochemistry testing processes require the least human intervention and they had a huge scope of automation whereas other pathology tests required

> market was the gap of preventive test care services for those who don't know there are three approaches to healthcare the first approach is disease treatment in this approach we do the tests and buy medicines after we fall sick the second
> approach is preventive care approach in this approach you do your tests before you get the disease or when the disease is at an early stage this is where you get regular Health checkups thyroid tests and diabetic test done and the third approach is wellness and here's where you build such a healthy lifestyle that you minimize the chance of falling ill in the first place so to keep yourself healthy you will eat organic vegetables you will go to the gym and you will have supplements to live a healthy lifestyle

> so did other competitors in the market right then what did thyrocal do special to beat its competition well the first thing he did was build a hub and spoke model so as we saw biochemistry test samples could remain stable for a long time and could be transported over a long distance so what Dr wilmani did was that he established a network such that he had multiple test collection centers but a single test lab

> thyrocare only offered 200 tests and for the rest of the test they simply outsourced it to other companies and all other centers that is a b c and d they were just collection centers with just basic piece of equipments like refrigerators and centrifuge so now the question over here is why did thyroid offer only 200 tests while its competitors were offering 3500 tests well that is because again Dr willmani only wanted those tests that had high customer lifetime value scalability and
> most importantly the tests needed to have a scope of automation so by choosing the skill scalable and high profit tests thyrocare could always enjoy High profit margins on the balance sheet and at the same time they could save a ton of money by not investing money to the equipments for 3500 test
