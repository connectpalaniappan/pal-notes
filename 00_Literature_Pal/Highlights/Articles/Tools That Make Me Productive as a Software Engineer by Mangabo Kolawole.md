> I really don't like moving tickets around or spending a lot of time on ticket reports. This tool makes those tasks easier and a lot of developers I know like using it every day. This is why I want to introduce Linear.

> While Notion is a fantastic tool and many might wonder why it's not my go-to for documentation, I find it leans more towards note-taking. Despite Notion's widgets enhancing its capabilities, I've recently needed a straightforward offline tool for organizing ideas and linking them effectively. Obsidian excels in this area, surpassing Notion in backlinking and idea organization.
