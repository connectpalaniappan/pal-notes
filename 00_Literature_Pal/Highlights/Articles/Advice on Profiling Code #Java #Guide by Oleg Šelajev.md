> I'm here with Johannes from Submachine what do people misunderstand about profiling their code they think that profiles reduce the crown truth but essentially profiles have problems so you have to know which the problems are and you have to deal with them and you want to first before profiling have a mental model understand your code and then you can start profiling because then you can go over all the backstage profiles sometimes have for Java I would recommend using profile because it's like widely known to be to be good it gives you lots of options and if you want to run it on Windows you're out of
> luck but then use jdk flight recorder it also works in Windows but isn't that accurate usually
