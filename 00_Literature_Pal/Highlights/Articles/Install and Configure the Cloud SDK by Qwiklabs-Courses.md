> Now let’s explore the Cloud Software Development Kit (SDK), which lets users run Google Cloud command-line tools from a local desktop. The Cloud SDK is a set of command-line tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. These include: the gcloud CLI, which provides the main command-line interface for Google Cloud products and services, gsutil (g-s-util), which lets you access Cloud Storage from the command line, and bq, a command-line tool for BigQuery.
> When installed, all of the tools within the Cloud SDK are located under the bin directory. To install the Cloud SDK to your desktop, go to cloud.google.com/sdk and select the operating system for your desktop; this will download the SDK. Then follow the instructions specific to your operating system. After the installation is complete, you’ll need to configure the Cloud SDK for your Google
> Cloud environment. Run the gcloud init (gee-cloud in-it) command. You will be prompted for information including your login credentials, default project, and default region and zone.
