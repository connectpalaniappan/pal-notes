> is a so engine are also satellite requires Electronics to design something so now I
> they give you [Music] some
> hello everyone thanks for joining the fourth episode of K talks and today we are going to continue episode with gaj we are going to continue the AO related field and I have a special guest today you know a college senior I got to know him very recently but I I'm feeling really grateful that I met him so Mr ntin is here um and I would like to spend that time in asking questions so I'll park that
> for later and I let ntin Ana to uh give introduction about him Anna welcome to the K talks and please uh help our audience to know you more thank you so much rag it was absolutely a delight to know talk to you interact and understand the work that you're doing and hi to the audience uh sorry if I have a tendency to speak a lot in English so
> so no no worries yes so okay so B history about me is that I am not an aeronautical engineer as people pered me to be engineering electronics and communication engineering Masters electrical engineering and aerospace engineering department as PhD research so as usual in work is more multi-disciplinary in nature in start uh
> I think we'll talk more about what I do and things like so it will probably inspire people to take up engineering which is a lot challenging as well as so yeah over to you thank you natak thanks for the brief introduction so I I can't uh stop but asking this one of the toughest paper Digital Signal processing we call it as degree stopping paper many of the
> engineering audience uh from VRA College of Engineering ug M what makes you to pursue uh in the university in America especially the digital signal processing how did you make the move what makes you to decide that this is the right uh subject for me to Master on okay so uh before we get in degreeing papering
> fundamental signals and system starting point and not many people know I had an so yes that was there but I was always fascinated by signals signals into the end of the day so been always fascinated by that
> in fact remember engineering first physics one
> know how sound bounces of different things how do you perceive sound the physics of sound itself I was looking at the physics I saw it as more of a physics problem than as an engineering problem at that point in time so that's where it all started and then of course engineering happened and systems digital communication Digital Signal passing and a whole bunch of courses when there electronics and
> and of course my I think I did it in Robo graduate 2009 was a tough time overall in the world told
> I was in in college me and I was also fascinated by joining to
> of I did take up the the short service commissions andun I qualified the exam but I wasting Indian Armed Forces they have set of stringent interview roles
> but I was waiting for the interview call I Was preparing myself for that but then what happened became a little expensive
> I had to take a call in joining Masters I don't regret it I don't regret that call but luck might have it so I had already taken a decision so I missed that opportunity I still regret it to this dat not joining the Armed Forces especially in engineering stream because it's a very crucial aspect of
> I I got an in University of Southern California Los Angeles it's also called University of spoiled children because it's people presume it to be a little expensive to join structur arent there are other universities in the US which also does the same thing so us is not just the school which is considered to be very expensive but now specific
> electric was a school for Signal processing and imaging CP signal and imageing Institute it's a small Branch within electrical engineering at uscss
> solom a faculty in electrical engineering
> Al I had a couple of other AD they were taking networks as a course
> elects networ I had a good fun the networks communication
> so but it was not the competition as such but it was rather the thrill of learning something new
> and of course 2011 I graduate I was looking for jobs I was interning with a couple of other companies opportunities came and went and uh I had some you know family to come back to India so India 2012 I think I returned back to India at that point in time
> to be very honest I could search for an opportunity I didn't really think about it at that point in time
> I joined as a project staff I didn't join as a PhD student at that point in time so the project staff take research projects they take so you basically student but you are a employee of the lab and you work on Research problems
> so I still continue to be in Signal processing but not that signal processing that people perceive it to be of course I appeared for interview for
> life Journey very very inspiring so so amazing amazing amazing journey now jokes apart amazing journey very inspiring as well so help me with this now why PhD yes and why PhD in Indian Institute of science uh also related question how it does differ from
> any other uh research or phds across other institutes okay great question of course it's not just about doctorate or philosophy mad scientists of course there are people who are math scientist in the mar and then what people what I saw was it was not an
> course it's not like a degree master's degree it is rather the fun of doing research research you learn something you apply your principles and you try to do something novel engineering companies you it is basically about applying principles whatever is required at that point in time develop commcial so lot of people pick up skills like that research it's slightly little different where there are two kinds of
> research one is very physical in nature which is like physics mathematic application PHS where you learn engineering skills you apply those techniques learn something new about it and Foundation Learning
> more than years so it takes a lot of effort to um know realize how your technology is going to grow and so that is what motivated me to take a PhD so PhD is more like a work of work
> where I apply um you know the knowledge that I learned over time Al to a variety of different things that is more interesting to do so research there is no clearcut definition what should be done outome so I was interested in doing that
> so that's why I took a PhD and of course there lot of science is a very fascinating mathematics is a language of science so
> was a very fascinating so that's how I landed in p uh of course real life is different
> compared to what we per see so P you learn a lot of things and the thrill of learning is what ultimately M motivated me to take up why in India yes India there a lot of I I lot of people do very fascinating research work I is more technologically oriented Indian Institute of Technology teally oriented of research is more fundament in nature so they focus more on science they also
> have engineering departments and Engineering they apply physics a lot and phys working which is Aeros Space Engineering so yeah that's that's my thank you man before we get into the
> Aerospace and analytical I would like to touch upon couple of items now so uh help us understand how are the colleges in India versus abroad since you have done Masters in us in one of the top institutes what did you feel and uh tell us more about that okay now I'm not going to comment on the undergrad colleges uh City AFF colar comp and I believe that comp in apples and oranges because the system is
> completely different in US versus India but I would like to touch upon the Institutes of higher education like and I in particular because and research insute or any any University abroad including European universities Australian universities uh even American
> universities North American University Canada America like uh it's more Hands-On coor which so predominantly most of the faculties every faculty is given their Liberty to structure their courses
> they have their own methodology of teaching they cover multiple topics cover
> at the same time if you don't perform well in a particular subject doesn't mean it is the end of the world they give you opportunities to uh take other credits so
