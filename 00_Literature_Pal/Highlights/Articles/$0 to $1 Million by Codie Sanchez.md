> how do you make your first milon you're starting from scratch at zero I would go and become really valuable to the most valuable person I could find and I deliver that to probably 10 people cuz nine of them are going to say no and one of them is going to think that that's really useful and say like pay me whatever you think this is worth or let me take a cut of whatever you think this is worth because there's a weird thing about money which is when somebody has money already and you can accelerate their money you can make money faster if I had to go start from 0 again yes I could go start from zero get my first couple thousand and work my way up or I
> could leverage Dan's money much more intelligently and as long as I took 0 from him and said I only want upside only pay me if this wins and succeeds and it's just net you know to you and then some net to me on top that's what I would do
