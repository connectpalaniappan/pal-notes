summary:: The text explains the importance of maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth in investments. Withdrawing contributions early can result in missing out on significant future investment growth, potentially costing thousands of dollars. Responsible long-term investing in a Roth IRA is emphasized for retirement planning and financial security.

> Roth IRA is a self-directed retirement account
> where you can contribute after tax dollars to be invested. Since the money going in is taxed, the growth of your investments are not taxed and the money withdrawal from the account are never taxed either, as long as you don't try to pull out some of the money before the age of 59.5. There is no such thing as a joint Roth IRA. So if you and your spouse want to contribute to one, then you'll have to do it individually, hence the name Individual Retirement Account. If you both have enough earned income separately, then you can each invest up

> to the $6500 limit for the year. If one of you works and the other doesn't, but you file a joint tax return, then the person working can, of course, contribute to a Roth IRA and your spouse can contribute to a Spousal Roth IRA as well

> member, these accounts are owned by the individual person and on paper, not co-owned by both people. I want to try to encourage you to max out your Roth IRA every single year, if possible, because if you don't do it for that year,
> then in the future you cannot go back and contribute for a previous year once that time limit has passed. A Roth IRA is one of those accounts where I would bend over backwards to make sure that I can put in the full amount allowed every single year. In my order of operations for what to do with your money, I have maxing out a Roth IRA right after investing up to your employer match and HSA. That is how important this type of account is. The good news with this is that you actually have a timeframe of 16 months to contribute
> for each calendar year. So if we are in 2023 right now, then you have from January 1st, 2023, up until when taxes need to be filed for that year to contribute, which in this case, would be April 15th, 2024

> Once you deposit money into your Roth IRA, there's one more extremely important step you need to do that I see a ton of people missing, and that is actually investing the money. I can't tell you how many people I've talked to over the years who just put money into the account assuming it would automatically grow, or knowing that they needed to invest the money,
> but just forgetting to do it because life happens, and things naturally slip out of our mind, only to check their account balance years later, realizing that it hasn't grown in value because they didn't invest the money

> When you contribute to a Roth IRA, all of your money is not locked up until 59.5. You can withdraw the contributions that you've made

> For example, if you've contributed $6500 and the account has grown to $10,000, then you can withdraw the $6500 contribution, but you cannot touch the $3500 gain without paying a penalty until 59.5. I've gotta interject for a second to give my personal opinion on this. While withdrawing money penalty-free is an option,
> I want to encourage you not to do this. To be brutally honest, I think that doing this is one of the dumbest, most irresponsible, short-sighted things that you can do. Withdrawing just $6500 worth of contributions would cost you $65,000 in future investment growth

- [n] Good to know only gains are charged with penalty, not the contributions.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvpv5wj229kpp41gjdc1w0s8)

> I see way too many people doing is investing in a taxable brokerage account before they have their Roth IRA maxed out for the year. This is a huge mistake

> Some of you might be over the income limit to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA, or some of you will be at that point in the future as your income grows. You can still contribute to a Roth IRA to take advantage of the tax-free growth by doing a backdoor Roth. To simply explain the process, all you do is contribute
> to a traditional IRA. Do not invest the money yet. Then contact your brokerage to have them convert the money to a Roth IRA. Now, I have done it with M1 Finance before and it was extremely easy. It only took I think two or three days for the money to get into my Roth IRA. Only do this if it makes sense based on your current tax rates and future financial plans. There's two things that you can do. if you are someone who thinks that you might be over the income limit, but you are not going to 100% know until the year is over.
> Number one, you can either wait until January of the following year, like we talked about in one of the previous mistakes that I mentioned, or number two, you can just contribute the money to a traditional IRA, then do a backdoor Roth within the year to get the money into the account so it can be invested. That way, if you are over the income limit, you've already done the backdoor Roth. If you're under the income limit, no big deal 'cause you had to pay taxes on that money that was going into the Roth IRA anyways

> question I get a lot is whether or not you can contribute
> to a Roth IRA on different brokerages. The simple answer is yes. This is how it would play out. You can contribute up to the max for one year on, say, M1 Finance. Then you can decide to contribute up to the max on fidelity the next year. Then you can contribute up to the max on Vanguard the following year. So by the end of that third year, you would have three different Roth IRAs with three different brokerages, and there is no problem with that. You can take it one step further. If you decide, hey, out of these three, I actually like M1 finance better than the other two,

> you can convert the Roth IRAs with Fidelity and Vanguard into your M1 Finance Roth IRA. You can also split up your contribution for the same year among different brokerages. So if for this year you want to say contribute $4,000 to an M1 Finance Roth IRA and the remaining $2,500 into a Fidelity Roth IRA, then you can do that without any problems. The only thing you cannot do is try to game the system by saying contributing $6500
> into an M1 Finance Roth IRA and $6500 into a Roth IRA with another brokerage. You cannot exceed the maximum amount allowed per year across all of your Roth IRAs on all of your brokerage accounts. Technically, you could do that since all of the brokerages aren't talking to each other to keep track of what you are contributing, so you have to self-manage this. I would highly, highly recommend making sure that you do not do this,
> whether it's on purpose or on accident. I don't know what the penalty is for this, but all I know is that you do not want to get caught trying to defraud the government in any way, shape, or form. Long-term investing is the name of the game with a Roth IRA. This money is for when you are in retirement, so make sure to take that into account when investing this money. No gambling it on stocks that random YouTubers are promoting. I think the two or three fund portfolio is perfect for your Roth IRA, which you can learn more about in these videos to your left.
