Checkout my second Channel:  @NeetCodeIO  

Today I gave a mock google coding interview to @FryingPan  who is a former intern at Meta currently studying for coding interviews as he finishes up school. He also recently interned at Meta in NYC.

Btw this is the question I asked: https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/
We actually solved it on the channel here: https://youtu.be/j4KwhBziOpg

> let's say we use a hash map to insert these values

- [n] Hashset is a good choice to not store duplicates  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyg75gxar007tws0bz0ksng)

> we remove something um we switch it with the end of the array and then we remove it that will be all of one and then we can just use the random.choice on the original list because they won't have all the values

- [n] Removing an element from the end is faster  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsygwrjmjmz0k3360b7q13t1)

> I think uh what comes to mind is instead of uh associating each value with just one value one index I can put an array here and um instead of counting okay so if I use an array I can store multiple indices so if I have a four I
> have I can have a four at index one I can have a four at another index and by having that um yeah then we just have to uh update the so in that case the remove can just uh Delete any of these fours right it can be the first four four or the second four the third four it doesn't really

- [n] When there are duplicates to track, you can track those as multiple values in hashmap  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsyht6jkmk2ch2w6nxbg76nv)
