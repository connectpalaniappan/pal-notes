> today's the day we're building the fence once the ground is prepped I'll mark every 7 ft to know where to dig the post holes the holes should be at least a third of the height of the fence add fast setting concrete mix and about a gallon of water and work it in with a shovel once you've marked your post tighten both the top and bottom brackets and make sure they're leveled you'll want to put two screws in the picket at every rail intersection cut the top off of the post I'll add this 2-in Post Cap which will keep water and debris out
