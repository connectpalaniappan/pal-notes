summary:: Elon Musk's innovative thinking is based on a combination of Wright's Law and First Principles Thinking, allowing him to revolutionize industries. Wright's Law describes the impact of incremental innovation on cost, while First Principles Thinking enables radical innovation by breaking down problems into basic elements and reassembling them from scratch. Musk's approach involves questioning fundamental truths and finding creative solutions beyond incremental innovation.
