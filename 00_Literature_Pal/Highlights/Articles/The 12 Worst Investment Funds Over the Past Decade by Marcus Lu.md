summary:: The list of the 12 worst investment funds over the past decade includes funds focusing on emerging markets like China and those following an "inverse equity" strategy. Funds shorting major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have faced significant losses over the 10-year period due to the long-term upward trend in the U.S. stock market. Chinese-focused funds have also suffered as Chinese equities stumbled for various reasons, including a sluggish COVID-19 recovery and government crackdowns on tech firms.
