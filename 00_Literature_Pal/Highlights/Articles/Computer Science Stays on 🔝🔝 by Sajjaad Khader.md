> computer science electrical engineering Computer Engineering comsi is very theoretical and it's more software focused while electrical engineering is more application wise Hardware focused Computer Engineering is a little mix of both you might think that you could learn more during Computer Engineering but I don't think it's a good use of your time you learn a bit of Hardware a bit of software but you don't actually Master any rather pick computer science or pick electrical engineering and then after completing your degree you specialize in one of those fields what I'm saying is you top up your pudding with some candy in different styles with whether it's data science or software

- [n] Agree, it would be a good idea to pursue computer science or electrical engineering instead of computer engineering which is mix of both computer science and electrical engineering.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw1esmb2dyfsxr4ny216qt9r)
