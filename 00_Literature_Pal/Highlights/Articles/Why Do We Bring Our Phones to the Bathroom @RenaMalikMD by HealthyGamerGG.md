> why are we so addicted to our phones that we have to take them with us to the bathroom so I think one of the things that we've like lost is the ability to be bored mhm if you really look at it we try to externalize our attention and we try to have our attention constantly be on like a particular thing and be somewhat entertained because if we especially look at the bathroom it's like what are you giving up right it's not like you're doing any important work in there it's not like you're going to be laughing really hard like you know sometimes like social media and technology is about like lots of fun like let's watch some cat videos and and
