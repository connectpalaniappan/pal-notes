> absolute danger category is a super refined oil but we can't possibly imagine what process it goes through to reach that oil in our table can you explain so the first process it undergo is heat so the nut or seed is heated at extremely high temperature so when it is exposed to such high heat the first thing that goes is the nutrition value then to extract the oil there's a chemical used which is called hegan hegan is a petroleum derivative and now it starts looking very black so there's a lot of bleaching agents added to bring
> it back to its clear glistening color and then the fourth step by this time it's also started smelling really bad there is deodorizers added to the oil actually what we left with after this process is not a food anymore it's a highly highly highly refined product we are eating it as food which is creating disease inside our bodies wow
