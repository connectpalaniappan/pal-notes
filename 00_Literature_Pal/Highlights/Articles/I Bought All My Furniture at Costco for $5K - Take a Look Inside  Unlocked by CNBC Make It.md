> This bed is from Costco. The mattress is from Costco. Pillows are from Costco. Plates... Costco. Costco. Costco. Little bowls. All Costco. Costco is a safe place for me. Just the smell of Costco relaxes me. I don't know, I just feel at home when I'm at Costco. The number of items I have in my apartment from Costco amounts to over $5,000. My name is Claudia Chee. I'm 33 years old. I live in Fremont, California and 95% of my apartment is from Costco.
> I found this apartment when I was visiting a friend that lived on the third floor, and when I walked in, it just felt and smelled like home. My budget was between $2000 and $2500, I was willing to pay.
> I've been shopping at Costco since I was 8 or 9. I would follow my parents to get glasses at Costco. The optometry department. And then we would eat samples and we bought everything in bulk at Costco. I would walk around Costco for a couple of hours every time I went to work to wait off the traffic. It was a safe place for me, and eventually, if you're walking around stuff, you eventually start to buy things. And that's how I have accumulated so many things.
> During a time when I was going through tough times in my life, I would find myself at Costco and whether I was shopping or just having samples, it just... It was always there, it was very consistent. Hi, guys. Welcome to my place. Come on in. I have like, ten blankets from Costco. They're all in the wash. This bed is from Costco. The mattress from Costco.
> Pillows are from Costco. This little thing on the side is from Costco as well. And now into my bathroom. Let's see. Towels. All the products inside. All from Costco. Toilet paper. Oh, these are all Costco. My little toilet cleaner's Costco. My trash can's Costco. My glasses are all Costco. These are my favorite Costco. It's kind of ugly, but this is Costco. This is Costco.
> My contacts are Costco. Don't forget about these. Fabric softener, Costco. Laundry detergent, Costco. This is my closet. A lot of my clothes are from Costco. Some of my shoes. My UGGs are from Costco. These pants are from Costco. Uh, these flannels are from Costco. What do I like about the things from Costco? Check out my sweater. Costco. This one was gifted to me from Costco when I went to the grand opening at Newark.
> Um, one of my favorites, actually. This one. Um, and then this one was from one of the girls. She does a lot of stitching, so it says hot dogs, which is what they're known for at Costco. So now I have two, one of each color. And thirdly, another, another girl, she did a sweater called I'd Rather Be at Costco. Very fun. And I wear this too. So these are my Costco sweaters that I wear sometimes from time to time. These pictures are from Costco, when Costco used to, um, let you print things.
> Also from Costco. So now we have a living room and into the kitchen. My whole couch, pillows, little tray. This book is from Costco. All Costco. My plants are from Costco. A lot of my books are from Costco as well. And of course, my piano and the sheepskin rug -- also from Costco. These chairs, Costco. I guess a lot of my apartment's Costco. So into my fridge over here. This was made from these, also from Costco.
> One of my favorite things -- of course, my badge. So I had an employee write this for me says Happy Birthday. Got this on my birthday. This is from Costco. It's a grazing board. NutriBullet, the Ninja sparkling water maker. This picture from Costco as well. Costco. Costco, Costco. Protein bars from Costco. You even have like immune gummies from Costco. It's all Costco. Costco kettle. Costco Tupperware. My biggest favorite thing is probably my coffee machine, also from Costco.
> I don't have much out here. I just moved in, but I do have a paddle board from Costco as well. And with time I did see some furniture, uh, on sale and I hope to furnish that, uh, Costco. Costco. Costco. I was probably going at least 3 to 4 times a week, to the point where I got to know the employees and they're like, Claudia, you got to, you have to do something like, you're always here.
> I kept filming clothing for some reason, and I found it very niche. If you look at their clothing, it just kind of sits out. It's not really modeled. You don't really know what it looks like on somebody. And so that was the idea to kind of showcase what the clothing looks like in the store. Since starting Costco Claudia, I've worked with 60 brands and counting within Costco. I'm not part of anything. I'm not affiliated with Costco at all.
> In terms of brand deals or anything, I'm still trying to figure out pricing. But one Instagram post ranges from $3500 up to $7000 and above. For teaching piano lessons it's about $5000 a month. And for Costco Claudia, I make around $7,000 a month. I have thought about working for Costco. I feel like what I do now is something that is more aligned to who I am.
> I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I've always wanted to be my own entity, my own business. Yes, I'm using Costco and their name and their brand, but I'm doing it in my own way. If the opportunity arose and Costco reached out and wanted me to work with them, I would be i nterested and overjoyed and yeah. My background is in marketing sales, like being a brand ambassador. I'm used to speaking.
> I'm used to representing something. I'm used to advocating for something. And to do it for something that I really love -- that means a lot to me as Costco Claudia. It's almost like my dreams are coming true. Um, yeah. I'm getting emotional. Costco means a lot to me. I'm still trying to put it into words as to why it is, but, um. I think it has to do with being my safe space.
> Honestly, I'm rolling with the punches. I think the sky's the limit. I know I'm gonna keep running with it. And I think there's so much to come, and I really hope to just keep an open mind. I'm really excited to see what's to come.
