summary:: Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content by learning from existing data. It uses machine learning models, particularly deep learning with neural networks, to understand patterns and generate new information. This technology can produce text, images, and more, making it versatile for various applications.

> two of the most common classes of machine learning models are unsupervised and supervised ml models the key difference between the two is that with supervised models we have labels labeled data is data that comes with a tag like a name a type or a number
> unlabeled data is data that comes with no tag
