> basically find a piece of land and if you found that piece of land and over a period of time you maintained it and actually made it better for the community you were able to stake claim to that property and it now became yours it happens with other purposes of buildings as well you can actually find
> a house and if you've lived there for a period of time and you've paid all the bills and no one has stake claim to that specific property you can get something called adverse possession and then the property becomes yours and those are like the good cases those are the people that really want a piece of land or really wanted a piece of property they maintained it and over a period of years they were able to get it what we're talking about here are the squatters that are not necessarily doing the right thing uh in that melee if you will there
> was seven other people in a house guns drugs in the house ketamine children in a house and according to the landlord they haven't paid the rents in months in Atlanta right now it's estimated there's over 1,200 homes that were vacant that are now currently being occupied by squatters can you imagine being on active dity and you've served your country you've paid your mortgage you've paid your HOA you made sure the property

> they have a law like they just passed in Florida to the new state law that now allows squatters to be thrown out of homes that don't belong to them Governor Ronda santz signed the bill this afternoon in Orlando I'm going to break this down for you because I'm not going to read you the whole 10-page law but it is
> it's such a good law such a good law so let's talk about it first of all it's a quick removal of unauthorized occupants homeowners or their authorized agents can ask from help from local sheriff's office to quickly remove people from the property two the conditions for removal the property must have a residential dwelling the occupants must have entered without permission and refused to leave when asked these occupants can be either current or former tenants under a valid agreement with the owner meaning if you
> have a lease you can't just get kicked out from this law nor can they be family members so if your family members are squatting in your house you can't kick them out from this law either there shouldn't be any ongoing legal disputes over the property involving these occupants if you need to file a complaint you can go to the Sheriff's Office the owner and the agent must fill out a detailed Complaint Form swearing under penalty of perjury that they provide information is true this form includes affirmations of the ownership the properties being residential and the presence of the unauthorized occupants
> so once that happens the sheriffs receive a valid complaint the sheriff can serve notice to vacate the unauthorized occupants squatters and help the homeowner regain possession of the property the sheriff can arrest the occupants yay if they have legal cause such as trespassing so fees and liabilities next is the law allows the sheriff to charge any fees for their service homeowners are not liable for any loss or damage to the occupant's
> property unless wrongly removed however if the homeowner wrongfully uses this process to remove someone they can be sued for damages so don't get sneaky so let's talk about the criminal penalties there are penalties for unlawful detaining or occupying residential property especially if there's significant damage caused also presenting false documents like a lease or a deed to claim rights over the property is penalized so they can't come
> in with those sneaky fake documents and say oh I have a lease and then of course it's not legal and they've faked it they're going to get in trouble and this law emphasizes that the homeowner's rights to control their property and aims to protect it from unauthorized use theft vandalism and providing a quicker remedy to remove squatters and unauthorized occupants I personally think it's a great law every state should do it and more states are looking into it including Georgia thank goodness because it's become a real issue in the
> Atlanta area but let's just say your state doesn't have a law like Florida what is it that you can do if you're having a squatting problem

> my permission may I have the keys sure can maybe you're a squatter trying to outmaneuver a squatter um my attorney has the papers that says it's my house well I brought my bathrobe I think I'm going to go move in come with me totally interesting concept so basically what happens is this that you squat on the squatter meaning that as soon as those
> people leave the building and it's empty the person that is kind of the fake squatter that's trying to get the other squatters out have a legitimate legal lease from the homeowners to allow them into the property so they're able to walk into the property and sit down and say I now have a lease to this property I live here and the people that are illegally squatting of course they throw a really big fit and they they say they're not going to leave but but after a while when you have some stranger

> I'm going to save you the three minutes that it takes you to read it there's nothing in there that tells you what you can do if you have a squatter in your specific area the thing is is this is what you have to do is you're going to
> have to contact an attorney to understand the law in your specific area it does not matter what state city county you're in everybody's going to have a different rule when it comes to squatting but my best advice to you when it comes to this is always check with your local authorities when it comes to this in Louisiana you would check with the justice of the peace I know that sounds crazy but that's what we have to do here in Louisiana your state is going to have their own rules when it comes to handling it by the way squatting doesn't necessarily have to be in a piece of property that is vacant it can also be

> on a plot of land that has no structure on it whatsoever just recently a woman bought a piece of property in Hawaii for a deal during covid and she was very excited about her piece of property and then she got a lawsuit in the mail for her piece of land because a builder built a house on it Construction Company built a half million doll house on the wrong lot now the lot owner doesn't want the house and she's being sued they're suing her for owning a piece of land and
> now she has squatters living there because they live on her piece of land where he built the house the Builder claims that she's being unreasonable because there are other Lots in the neighborhood that she could move to he's willing to purchase the piece of property another one for her they mistakenly built the house on that specific lot and she wants money and damages I think she has every right to ask for the damages I don't know what Builder builds on a piece of land that
> they don't own granted it was a mistake but anybody that does a survey knows where the piece of land is supposed to be you're supposed to Mark the Four Corners before you ever put anything up in the meantime this is going to be a legal issue for her and the Builder I hope I hope that she gets her money all of it plus some and another lot that's just as beautiful now it's time for me

> them to look up that information what if a corporate investor like Trion or Black Rock had a list and gave it to a young kid and said hey I want you to start an Instagram account for rental properties and offer it at such a ridiculous price and you get to pocket all the money all you have to do is advertise these houses and not only that so your tenants get to stay in the houses as much as possible here's all the legal documents that you need to tie it up in the court system
> for as long as possible and you're thinking well how the heck does this really help corporate investors well what if the corporate investor came into the homeowners and said hey I heard that you have this squatting problem and it's causing you a lot of headache why don't I take this property off your hands for of course a discounted price because you know you have these squatters here it's going to cost us a lot of money in court documents to get them out out but we'll
> help you we're going to help you get out of the property and we'll buy it from you so you no longer have the headache there's going to be a lot of people that take that option because it is quite a headache then the corporate investors even own more of that specific area dictating market price for that specific area as well and they've been doing it if you watch any of my videos that's exactly what corporate investors have been doing dictating exactly how much homes have been selling for and how much their rent is going up and that's all they want to do is turn them into
