> This brings us to the end of the first module of the Google Cloud Computing Foundations course. Let’s do a quick summary. You started by exploring cloud computing. Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. Next, you compared and contrasted physical, virtual, and cloud architectures.
> You explored how cloud computing is a continuation of a long-term shift in how computing resources are managed, looking back through three different waves–colocation, virtualized data centers, and container-based architecture–and Google’s distinct positioning to propel organizations into the next wave of cloud computing. After that, you learned to differentiate between infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). From there, you were introduced to Google Cloud compute, storage, big data, and ML services.
> And finally, you examined the Google network and how it powers cloud computing.
