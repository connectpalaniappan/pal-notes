> I don't want to be the type of person who just coasts off of work that they did in the past there were people even at Google who were like really high level there was one guy like L7 engineer in the org that I was working in and he was really smart he did a lot of great work for that org several years ago at least while I was there it really seemed like he wasn't doing anything every time we had a meeting with him he was not even paying attention there were like two l7s that I somewhat worked with one of them didn't do anything and the other guy was like the complete opposite I swear he talked so fast if you ever
