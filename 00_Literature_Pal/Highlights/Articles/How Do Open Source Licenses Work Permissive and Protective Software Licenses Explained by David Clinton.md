summary:: Open source licenses come in two categories: permissive and protective. Permissive licenses, like the 2-Clause BSD License and the MIT License, grant users wide flexibility in using, modifying, and distributing software while also imposing certain obligations such as including copyright notices. Protective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License and the Mozilla Public License, ensure that derivative works are also licensed under the same terms, promoting the software's continued openness and development. Understanding these distinctions is crucial when working with open source resources to avoid infringing on others' rights.

> The 3-Clause BSD License, also known as the New BSD License, is similar to the 2-Clause BSD License but includes an additional clause that requires users to include a copy of the license and copyright notice in any distributions of the software. This license is commonly used for open source software projects that want to ensure proper attribution and give credit to the original authors or contributors.

> The Apache License version 2.0 is widely used for open source software projects, especially those related to web and server software. The license permits users to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software, as long as they include a copyright notice, disclaimer of any warranties or liability, and a notice of any changes made to the original software.

> The MPL was developed by the Mozilla Foundation â€“ the people behind the Firefox browser. It is a copyleft license that allows for the distribution of the licensed software under both proprietary and open source terms. The MPL is compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing code to be shared between MPL-licensed software and GPL-licensed software. The MPL is also compatible with other open source licenses such as Apache and MIT.
