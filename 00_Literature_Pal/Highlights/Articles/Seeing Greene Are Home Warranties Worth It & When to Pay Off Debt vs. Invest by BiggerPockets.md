> he's not really a seasoned real estate investor I'd probably tell him to you know get a helck and use that to maybe go do a smaller project to just cut his teeth a little bit in the real estate side of things I think that could be a small flip a small rehab a small bur

> he should ask is if I had $1.3 million would I buy this exact duplex right now or would I not if the answer is no I would say well what would I buy instead with 1.3 because that's maybe you sell
> it and put the money towards that if you say no I I like this duplex I would buy it now that means you should keep it now we can move on to our other options with what you've got obviously a duplex in Santa Barbara at 1.3 million is not very likely to cash flow very solid now it's paid for in cash so it's going to cash flow but if he puts leverage on it that's a different story if he was to borrow 80% of the value of this thing I doubt it would cash flow but it probably is going to appreciate over time so we could work some portfolio architecture into this portfolio

> more trouble because he's a new investor doesn't know what he's doing well that that's what I'm saying that's why I like a HELOC cuz a HELOC you don't really make payments on the Helo it's like a credit card you don't make payments on it unless you use some amount of that credit line if you will so I like that and I don't know if I said this a home equity line of credit that's what a hilock is it's basically borrowing against the equity of your property but I like that he has the option to basically have this big funding mechanism and he can just take as much as he need needs to start a project and
> see it through whereas if he goes and he does a refi like you're talking about um or like like you just mentioned 80% he's in debt now and he has to make payments and I think that's a tough treadmill to get started on especially at the $900,000 range so I'd rather him just have the option to to use his funds but not necessarily use them until until he's worthy right so let's talk pros and cons hel loock versus cash out refi you do go the cash out refi route Pros lower interest rate cons you you have to use
> that money for something cuz you're paying for it every single month it's not flexible another Pro it is taxfree well until with a helck but that is something to consider yeah they're both going to be taxfree that's right now the helck road the pros are going to be you have flexibility you don't have to use that money because you put a helck on it for a million or 1.1 or whatever he can get you don't actually pay a mortgage on that money until you use the money the con is that you're getting an adjust rate mortgage and the rate will be
> higher so okay because Evan is a newer investor we're leaning towards hilock because we don't want him to get stuck with all this money and not know what to do with it but if this was Rob or me it would make more sense for us to go the cash out refi route because now we could go deploy a million dollars or 900,000 without as much risk cuz we're a little bit more experienced so Evan we think you should take the HELOC and learn how to play Slowly like Rob said try to flip a house at a lower price point try to put money down on a vacation property and get try your hand at short-term
> rental investing or medium-term rental investing maybe even take some money out to put the down payment on a primary residence get yourself a house hack or something like that but don't go big at the point that you feel like I think I got this real estate thing down I know what I'm in for now you can talk about refinancing out of the HELOC into a Cash out refinance locking in a 30-year fixed rate getting the lower interest rate and then deploying the capital as you see fit how's that sound Rob love it yeah that's good yeah earn the right to use your 900k Don't Come Out Swinging the right right way to use 900k with Rob AB

> is it a good idea to buy a property that already has a tenant in it so that you get cash flow right off the bat or do you think that's a bad idea Rob I think the real estate community in general agrees it's a bad idea uh I don't think I know anyone that's
> ever been down I think pretty much you sometimes you might you'll read the only person that's down is the real estate agent who writes the description that says tenant already in place like it's a benefit outside of but they're also the same agent that's like location don't walk run oh so yeah I would say no it's not a good idea you want to screen your own tenant meet your own tenant build a rapport with your own tenant yeah just because you're previous the previous owner/ landlord liked the tenant and had
> a good rapport that doesn't mean that you're going to have that same relationship with them and they always say buyers are liars sellers are worse so you can't necessarily trust the seller of the property when they say oh yeah David he's a great tenant he pays on time every month uh because it's probably a little inflated there here's a good rule of thumb very few people who have a car that's working really well think about selling it and very few Real Estate Investors that have a tenant that's a really good good tenant want to get rid of the property with the tenant
> in it you're usually inheriting a problem okay that's a good so you're saying that every car on Craigslist there's something wrong under the hood there's a high percentage of people that are selling used cars that know the mechanic just said you're going to have to replace the whole thing and they said nope just going to sell it and let somebody else take care of it

> I'm okay with that if the owner is going to lease the property back from you that's different than inheriting a tenant that's usually a person who just needs more time to find their next property okay but that's like that does kind of open up a can of worms unlike the owner could technically they could be a awful I mean they they've already sold the house there's no real repercussions there so that could also be relatively risky right well you keep a deposit from them we do this all the time on the David Green Team you get a deposit it from the owner who is now a tenant
> because they're want to leasing it back from you for 3 months so if they tear up their own house because you own it now you take it out of their deposit

> dam you can get out of this debt much faster than people who don't use real estate investing so let's sum this up you're definitely going to house act you're going to use that physician loan and you're going to buy in the best neighborhoods that you can and get your housing expenses close to zero as possible we'd like to see you at 250 bucks a month or less for what you're coming out of pocket you're going to buy another house the next year and
> you're going to do the same thing you're going to repeat this you don't need to worry about burring right now because there's no point of pulling money out of a property if you're not putting much money down these physician loans give you a very low down payment option so don't worry about a complicated Burr and refinancing when you can just put low money down on the property after doing this for several years you should have three four five properties in great areas you should have no or low housing expenses yourself and you should be making good money that you're putting toward work is paying this debt off and there is a possibility that 5 years from
> now you've got $500,000 of equity in real estate and $300,000 paid off and you are 80% of the way to make yourself a millionaire yeah then it really starts stacking up when you got no debt and you're making that much money yeah you can you can become a millionaire in real estate I'm not going to say pretty quickly but much easier than most it's a
