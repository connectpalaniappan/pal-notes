> role labeled Principal Engineer will usually have the responsibilities of an architect. They can differ from one labeled Architect because they typically state requirements for more hands-on work

> For your career growth, resume titles should reflect the role's duties rather than just the job title


### id700838918
[[2024-04-01]] 07:52
> One way to do this is to put the job title and the role together in the description, for example: "Principal Software Engineer/Architect."


### id700839005
[[2024-04-01]] 07:53
> An architect’s other responsibilities require an up-to-date understanding of the code developed by the team.

### id700839230
[[2024-04-01]] 07:55
> This work may be delegated, especially if it's in an unfamiliar language or time constraints demand i

[[2024-04-01]] 07:56
> However, architects should do proof of concept work directly. It gives them a much greater understanding of how the technology works

> Chief Architects and similar leadership architecture roles focus more on business and technical strategy than implementation details


### id700840455
[[2024-04-01]] 08:01
> Early-stage startups or small companies may lean on high-level architect roles to do implementation work in the early phases. This early implementation allows these experienced engineers to set the stage and define a clear path for software development at the company. As the team scales up and the product matures, these engineers focus more on business and technical strategy and decouple from day-to-day programming.


### id700847504
[[2024-04-01]] 08:06
> Architects provide the most benefit performing higher-level responsibilities like research, mentoring, and strategy.


### id700847854
[[2024-04-01]] 08:07
> Productive but singular efforts:
> • Implementing a simple customer request
> • Fixing a typical bug
> • Designing a feature
> • Reviewing code to get it out the door
> • Churning on the backlog
> Force multiplying efforts:
> • Framework or library development
> • Debugging a complex problem that is blocking other developers
> • Mentoring others with their design or reviewing designs
> • Reviewing code to teach
> • Grooming the backlog
> • Research and developing proofs of concept
> • Defining best practices
> • Improving performance
> • Refactoring to illustrate best practices
> **Pro tip:** You can multiply force even more if you do these tasks indirectly by pairing with others to do them. Those you pair will learn to be force multipliers themselves


### id700847887
[[2024-04-01]] 08:07
> However, sometimes the most impactful thing an architect can do at the moment may be to get a critical feature out the door. Only sacrifice tomorrow's architecture for today's top priority if tomorrow depends on today's top priority.

### id700848194
[[2024-04-01]] 08:10
> higher-level architects focus more on business strategy, it's still essential to have a solid grasp of coding to be an effective architect.
