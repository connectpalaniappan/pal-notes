> As Americans tighten their spending by now, pay later apps are becoming more popular. They allow you to split your payments. Typically without interest, customers tend to use them to buy high cost items in the retail space, education, health care, and even insurance inflation is driving people towards buy. Now pay later loans. People can sometimes stack multiple loans at the same time and that can be fine if you're experienced with credit.
> And you've got a lot of expendable income and that sort of thing. And while they can be a good tool when used wisely, it also has its drawbacks. According to Lendingtree, one third of the people that used the service last year actually paid late half of the people financed a purchase knowing they could not afford it. And three out of 10 users use it as a bridge between paychecks.
