> Now let’s shift our focus to IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The move to virtualized data centers introduced customers to two new types of offerings: infrastructure as a service, commonly referred to as IaaS, and platform as a service, or PaaS. IaaS offerings provide raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers. PaaS offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure applications
> need. This allows more resources to be focused on application logic. In the IaaS model, customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time; in the PaaS model, customers pay for the resources they actually use. As cloud computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted toward managed infrastructure and managed services. Leveraging managed resources and services allows companies to concentrate more on their business goals and spend less time and money on creating and maintaining their technical
> infrastructure. It allows companies to deliver products and services to their customers more quickly and reliably. Serverless is yet another step in the evolution of cloud computing. Serverless computing allows developers to concentrate on their code, rather than on server configuration, by eliminating the need for any infrastructure management. Serverless technologies offered by Google include Cloud Functions, which manages event-driven
> code as a pay-as-you-go service, and Cloud Run, which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices–based application in a fully managed environment. You might also have heard about software as a service (SaaS) and wondered what it is and how it fits into the cloud ecosphere. SaaS applications are not installed on your local computer; they run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users. Google's popular applications like Gmail, Docs, and Drive, collectively known as Google
> Workspace, are all classified as SaaS.

- [n] Certainly! The terms IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, managed services, and serverless refer to different types of cloud computing service models and delivery methods. Here's an explanation of each with examples:
   1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, networks, and operating systems. Users have complete control over the virtualized infrastructure and can install, configure, and manage the operating systems and applications running on it.
   Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to rent virtual servers and configure them according to their needs.
   2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: PaaS provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Users can focus on developing and running their applications, while the provider manages the underlying servers, storage, networking, and other resources.
   Example: Google App Engine, which allows developers to build and run web applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
   3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, where the application is hosted and managed by the service provider. Users access the software through a web browser or a client application, and the provider handles the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and updates.
   Example: Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), which provides cloud-based productivity tools like Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sheets.
   4. **Managed Services**: Managed services involve outsourcing the management and maintenance of specific IT infrastructure components or applications to a third-party provider. The provider is responsible for monitoring, updating, and ensuring the smooth operation of the managed resources.
   Example: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), where Amazon manages the database infrastructure, including provisioning, patching, and backups, while the user retains control over the database configuration and data.
   5. **Serverless Computing**: Serverless computing (also known as Function as a Service or FaaS) is an execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of computing resources. Users write and deploy code as individual functions or event-driven applications, without the need to manage servers or infrastructure.
   Example: AWS Lambda, which allows developers to run code in response to specific events or HTTP requests without provisioning or managing servers.
   To illustrate with an example, let's consider building a web application:
   - **IaaS**: You rent virtual servers from a cloud provider like AWS EC2 and install the web server software (e.g., Apache), databases, and other required components yourself.
   - **PaaS**: You use a platform like Google App Engine and deploy your web application code, while Google manages the underlying infrastructure and server resources.
   - **SaaS**: You use a web-based content management system like WordPress.com or a customer relationship management (CRM) system like Salesforce, which is hosted and managed by the provider.
   - **Managed Services**: You use a managed database service like Amazon RDS or a managed messaging service like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), where the provider handles the setup, patching, and maintenance of these resources.
   - **Serverless**: You build and deploy individual functions or microservices using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, which run in response to specific events or HTTP requests, without provisioning or managing servers.
   These service models offer different levels of abstraction, control, and management responsibility, allowing organizations to choose the most suitable option based on their requirements, expertise, and desired level of control over the underlying infrastructure.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwpjt8kk5wfrvbneegg5kc12)
