> by the end of this video you'll know the six double strategies I wish I knew when I first started pickleball today's video is brought to you by Selkirk all right here's number one we're talking about what you do on the return right so we have the serving team over there we're the returning team it's me and it's Wendy so if we're returning I'm gonna be up here at this kitchen line Wendy's gonna be back there tip number one is return and run to the kitchen so when you're returning a big mistake is to return and stay you don't want to return
> and stay because you're not as dangerous when you're back at the Baseline here's what it looks like boom so as you saw in that example Wendy stayed back the entire time and they just kept hitting it back to Wendy the entire time she's not in a dangerous position so all of a sudden JT and Tyler got to the kitchen line I was at the kitchen line but Wendy was back they have the advantage so the mistake is return and stay what you want to do the
> strategy is return and run to the kitchen line here we go meet boom okay beautiful as you saw in the example Wendy's returning she wants to return the ball and get to the kitchen so she becomes more dangerous when Wendy and I are both at the kitchen line and the opponents are back at the Baseline we have the advantage because here's the thing your most dangerous at the kitchen line and when you're returning your best and first chance to get there is right
> off the return they have to let the ball bounce after we return the ball that's what the rule says so get to the kitchen line fast get to the kitchen line immediately get to the kitchen line now so you're more dangerous get the kids alive so you return the ball we just saw Wendy return the ball now we are standing at the kitchen line here's our second strategy stance in punch stance paddle up punch the ball we want to be able to master the fourth shots okay their serve is the first shot our return is the second shot then they're gonna hit a third shot and then now our fourth
> shot is us standing at the kitchen line but here's what you want to do you want to do three things after you return and run and get to the kitchen line number one you want to be in an active stance so many people just stand straight up number two you want your paddle position up in the air so if a ball comes hard at your face you're ready to just block instead of paddle being down and having to bring it all the way from here up to here and here's the third thing and maybe the biggest mistake that beginners make they take big long swings when
> they're at the kitchen line they come here and they take a big swing and that's exactly what happens it goes right into the net so number three is short compact swings so you don't over hit beautiful so that's the second one and those are three things to master your fourth shot here's number three sir and stay we were just talking about the return return and run stance and punch serve and stay the mistake that we often see at the beginner level is somebody serves the ball and they step into the
> court well I don't want to do that because if I do that if they hit a deep return I got a back pedal back because I have to let the ball bounce that's what the rule says if I find myself backpedaling well I'm not on balance I'm gonna have a tough time swinging through the ball in fact I'm probably gonna hit the ball up in the air and it's either going out or it's going to be a lob to the opponent here we go yeah so that's the mistake is to serve and move in what we want to do what you
> want to do is serve and stay because in pickleball we always want our momentum going forward toward the kitchen line where we're most dangerous so Wendy and I are going to serve we're gonna stay and we're gonna read what the return does from Tyler and then we're gonna make our decision so we serve it we stay now we come in and we play beautiful number four third shot tactics so what most players do on the third shot especially at the beginner level is only use one tactic okay so my first
> shot is the serve my the second shot is the return in the third shot the one that nearly 100 of players hit 98 points 16 of the time is they drive the ball as hard as they possibly can it's not a bad option just know it's not the only option so let me show that one I drive I serve return and I hit a drive okay that's option number one that's one of your tactics here's the second tactic that most beginners know nothing about it honestly just refuse to hit for a long
> time you know who you are okay it's called the drop the third shot drop so the serve is the first the return is the second in the drop is the third option so the third shot drive and the third shot drop are both tactics you can use to apply pressure to the person you're playing remember the drive is not the only option the drop is also an option the drive is one way to apply pressure right the drop is another way to apply pressure but it's a different way the goal of the drop as you see here you see the ball Landing in
> the kitchen is to give us time to get to the kitchen to be more dangerous because remember when you're at the kitchen you're the most dangerous here we go servant stay now we go okay so what you saw there is Wendy and I chose to why I hit it but when he told me to she told me to hit a drop and that allowed us to get to the kitchen line and allow us to be more dangerous that's another one of the tactics so let me go one step further on this tactic if you're gonna drive the ball where should
> you drive the ball let me just give you one option of where to drive it drive it at the person who's hitting the return because they're the one that's running in and it's harder to hit a ball on the Run than it is right here with JT who's standing still so for example nice it's hard for me to do he wants you to believe that he did that like for the video there's no chance he ever gets that fall that was a sick Drive okay driving the person running in now the second tactic and I'll be quick
> I won't hurry though John Wooden if you're gonna drop the ball where should you drop the ball he only wants me to give you one but I'm gonna give you two the first place would be into the middle okay so Tyler hits the return comes in and right now the first place is right into the middle why into the middle you ask it gives you the most room for error right if you go to the sidelines and you haven't done this a lot you're probably hitting the ball out both Sidelines now if you're a little more advanced and you do have pretty good control the place I would hit it to over to that person's backhand if you're on the right side or the left side just go to the left side player's backhand
> they have the least amount of offense trust me these two guys right here about four rows okay they're playing a match there they had to tell a story and they won the first match 11-9 I just told JT hey go start hitting every ball to that player's backhand they did it and then all of a sudden they won 11 to 15-6 Magic kinda here we go all right ball comes in serve okay over to that guy's backhand look at that it works give it a shot these guys are great number five hold the line huge
> mistake a lot of players make and it's a strategy that can help you the infinitely better when you're around the kitchen line now a lot of times beginner games don't even get to this place but let's imagine that yours you've been playing a higher level you are at the kitchen line playing into a dink rally right here okay if you're in this dink rally what you want to avoid is what Tyler's actually just been learning recently which is being sporadic at the line right here's what's sporadic at the line let's just go cross-court dinking she moves way back heavy footwork
> all over the place pause and people are watching this being like that's so obnoxious nobody trusts me a week ago this man right I was just playing naturally right there that's so very good he's so comfortable okay all right so that is a it's a mistake and here's why if you do that you're doing a couple things number one you're getting yourself off balance and the moment yo
