> this is a hydrating summer drink that'll help you go poop many of us are kind of backed up and you don't have to reach for dietary fiber supplements all you need is chia seeds 10 G of fiber per serving that's going to get you moving I'll add two scoops of chia seeds that's about 6 G of fiber and give the seeds a good mix up next add a stick of your favorite electrolytes I'm using the Flav City electrolytes because it's got a boatload of minerals in there unrefined salt from the USA and I'm the only one who uses real organic fruit no BS
