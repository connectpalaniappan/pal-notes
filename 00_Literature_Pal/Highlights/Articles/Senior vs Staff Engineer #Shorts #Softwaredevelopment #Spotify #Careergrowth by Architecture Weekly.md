> what's the difference between senior and staff engineer they work more cross Squad and maybe even cross mission level at Spotify and the scope of projects is much bigger and less defined if as a senior engineer given a task I would deliver this feature which is very time bound and very very clear for Stuff engineer okay here's a project we think that the company needs this how do we get from this very Loosely defined business requirement to actually produce some solution for it and then you don't
> know what the solution is you don't know how to approach it you don't know who is involved and then you start breaking up that task you wenter more into stakeholder management influencing people finding the right Solutions building your own if there is no existing solution there's a lot of architecture involved definitely communication sometimes you're going to be a product manager for a project sometimes you're going to be the delivery lead
