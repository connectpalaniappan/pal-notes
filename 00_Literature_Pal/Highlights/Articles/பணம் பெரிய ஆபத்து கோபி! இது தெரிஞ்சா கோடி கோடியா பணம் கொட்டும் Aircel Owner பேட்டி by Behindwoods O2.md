> What's wrong with me is that there is no competition in anything 3800 crores of money received I took 200 crores in my hand. there were people who gave me this coffee and tea. I gave them 25 lakhs. Money is dangerous for the rich. Because he want to protect that How to protect money. I did a coffee business. When I came into the coffee business
> Indians didn't even know the word espresso. In those days, without any problem, they gave me 7 central platforms. I sold coffee for 10 rupees there. I sold that company to Lavasa for 100 million dollars. I am happy that I was born in India. India is a fertile ground. If you sell coffee here, you can sell 23 crores a day. If you sell masala tea, you can sell 53 crores. I'll tell you something that people don't know. I sold a company, right? I wanted to sell it to AT& T for 40, 000 crores.
> For 50, 000 crores, I got 3, 800 crores of money. I took 200 crores in my hand. I gave 100 crores to my CEO. I gave money to everyone. I made 10 crores, 5 crores. Finally, in my room, there were people who gave me this coffee and tea. I have to give something to them, right? So I gave them 25 lakhs. Suddenly the girl received 25 lakhs fainted. Competition will really help you. Secondly, it will keep you technologically advanced. But the problem I have is that none of the businesses have no competition the biggest problem I have is that there is no competition
> Have it happened or have you chosen I have chosen. Then, I don't know what to do. By the time the competition comes, it will be sold. I filed for bankruptcy. I filed and sat at the Dubai airport. You, uh, Tata is our, uh, Ratan Tata is someone you like a lot. You are a big fan of his. You remember the times when you used to walk with him. Me? Yes, yes. But when you say that, Tata, uh, always, uh, his, uh, uh, his thoughts
> and ideas are not related to money. But on those days, my target was money. That's what you used to say. I would have said it wrongly to say on those days. Now a day also, today also my target is money. But on one hand you say there is no money and on the other hand you say the target is money. Look, Gobinath I am a mad man. I want you to practice selfishness. Gopinath, you have to do what is good for you.
> Isn't that good for your family? Isn't that good for your family? Isn't that good for Chennai? Isn't that good for India? This selfishness will become selflessness. I used to say I need money. But I don't work for money. Excellence is my objective. By product is profit. By-product comes only when I achieve excellence. When you were talking about wisdom and excellence, you said that the by product is money.
> When you were talking about Tata, you said that he always thinks money is a by product. But at that time, you said that you didn't think money was a by product. So now, in your experiences, you have come to a different understanding. It is the same experience sivashankaran was born on October 18, 1957. Okay. From that day till today, it's the same experience. It's a universal law. You work for excellence. You will succeed. The prize for that success is money.
> You may desire money. But you will not be greedy. Money has nothing to do with impetus. Many people think, I will be happy if I make a money. That is actually a wrong statement. If you are happy, you will make money. Yeah, that's also true, but to some extent, they say that people who have a lot of money don't get a lot of happiness out of money. That's because, No, that's true, that's true. It's called, when you go to the sea and take a bath They always take me up to 30 meters.
> After that, they shout me to come out one day I asked, I want to go another 20 meters. Sir, the weight of the sea water will become a problem for you. That's when I realized that if I have a 1 liter bottle of water I can control it. But if I'm in the water, now water is controlling me as long as we control the money, we'll be happy. Money comes and goes happily. Because money starts controlling.
> But you can only know when money comes. You can only know when money comes. I'll give you an example. A monk's penance is his danger. Similarly, a rich man's money is his danger. Because he want to protect the money he is worried constantly how to protect it, Everybody know very well how to create a money how to protect money. That is what I am studying now. I don't know only how to protect the money You can send someone to me
> In fact, if you want guidance to make money You can be a graduate You can even be a housewife i will give you my email siva@io.com I am teaching you for free. Don't ask me only one thing. How to protect When reading the kanadhasan poem I Thought to experience everything So, I bought a plane for 700 crores I met many people. I bought an island. I bought a house in many countries.
> I met many people. I ate many foods. I saw many doctors It my habit to spend if I have money, I need to save it for a long time. I don't think I should do all Your business model is a bit, uh, uh, I feel like it's a bit outdated. It's just my guess. I don't know if it's right or not. Right now, the concept of building a company is building a value for it.
> the one who first taught that to India That's what I'm asking. Today's day and age, in the modern business era, building a business, building a value for it, and selling it at a high price But you started this business a long time ago. I am a trendsetter and pioneer I encourged most of the companies I did a coffee business. When I came into the coffee business, Indians didn't even know the word espresso. How I came into the espresso business is, I sent our 80 coffee seeds to swizz
> But he would look at it through a microscope and say, out of the 80 coffees, 37 are bad quality. He said that coffee can't be made with these. After that, he studied about coffee. Dr.Eileen, who was the world's number one, got a distribution from him. He said that the people would benefit from coffee. Back then, without any problem, they gave me 7 central platforms. I sold coffee for 10 rupees.
> I sold that company to Lavasa for 100 million dollars. Okay. When I say this coffee, there is no antioxidant like coffee. I mean, building and selling the value of the company, whether it is Amazon or any big company, if the company is at a loss, the value of the company will be high. How did you feel about this model? How to develop? There is a slogan for that. You innovate, you replicate, you integrate. For example, Now i want to sell a company
> i will set up a coffee shop. If you set up a coffee shop as a model and If you run this coffee shop for 1 lakh rupees, you will get a profit. I will tell you all the details of it beautifully. You can set up a coffee shop like this in India. If it happens, give me 1, 000, 000, 000 rupees. So again, on the business model. Now, second There is other model also
> This model is difficult to understand But I try my best to educate you If Mukesh Ambani had a store 1 Ruppee Profit = 300 Rs share 3 Ruppee Profit = 900 Rs Share So if big companies earn 1 Ruppee it earn 250 but if you and I start, if we earn 1 rupee, the value is only 15 times. Only 15 rupees.
> Our company, Adani, Ambani, Tatas, if they buy, for their earning per share, the day they buy from us, it goes to 250 rupees. Without that, they don't have to give money. We give the share and put it. That's why, I have two problems in my mind. One is admitted desire. What is admitted desire? Let me give you an example. My admitted desire is to serve the people. To exceed their expectations in terms of price, performance, quality, delivery.
> I want to make their wishes come true. I want to give them happiness. I want to improve their situation. I want to improve their situation. Unadmitted desire, do you know what it is? We are building this I.O. company, right? We have to sell it for 60, 000 crores. 8 billion dollars. But some people have an opinion that it is not good to build a company with such an exit point in mind. That is their opinion, sir.
> there is a Tamil song. "Black is my favorite color" (Tamil Song) That is my opinion Others say they like white He is entitled for his opinion. Underst
