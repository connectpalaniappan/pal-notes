> one question I get a lot is if you were 25 years old where would you live to maximize your financial returns this is the most obvious answer in the world which is the Bay Area the reason is this is the place where you go to get work done there's a reason why most of the Magnificent Seven were founded and built and scaled not just specifically in the Bay Area but in the peninsula meaning South of San Francisco the interesting thing about paloalto is that there's literally nothing to do there it's a place where you come to work if you're trying to do something really important it takes enormous dedication almost to
