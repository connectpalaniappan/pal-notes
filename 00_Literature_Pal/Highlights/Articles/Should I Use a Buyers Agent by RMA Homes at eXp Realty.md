summary:: The video argues that using a buyer's agent may not benefit you when purchasing a house. The author believes that not having a buyer's agent can make your offer more appealing to the seller. They claim that the commission splitting between agents doesn't affect the seller, so it's more advantageous for you to go without a buyer's agent.

> two seconds to talk about buyer's agents tips that realtors do not want you to know about you do not need a buyer's agent to purchase a house in fact it makes your offer worse i mean i gotta say i respectfully disagree with what you're saying it makes no difference to the seller whether the realtor has to split the commis seller is going to be paying the same commission either way so the only person that it looks more favorable is you
