> As you explore the role of the Professional Cloud Architect at Cymbal Direct in this course, you’ll also explore different sections of the exam guide, which forms the basis for the Professional Cloud Architect certification exam. In the following modules, diagnostic questions will help you assess your knowledge of each section of the exam guide. The exam guide for the Professional Cloud Architect Certification is divided into 6 sections that contain one or more objectives. We’ll focus on where you can find resources at the section objective level.
> The exam guide is on the certification page of our online documentation. Note that there there is a separation between the team that develops the Professional Cloud Architect exam questions and the team that develops the courses and exam preparation materials. The course developers and instructors do not know what question will be on your Professional Cloud certification exam, and your exam might be different to everyone else’s. The goal of this course is to determine what you know and what you don’t know to help
> you prepare a study plan and be ready for the Professional Cloud certification exam. Later, when you take the exam, you will demonstrate whether you have the skills and knowledge required to earn the Professional Cloud Architect certification. Throughout this course, you’ll be pointed to specific resources and documentation that can help you fill the gaps you identify through the diagnostic questions. Let’s go over the types of resources you may want to include in your study plan. Google provides resources to help you develop your skills and experience with Google Cloud
> solutions. The learning path for this certification includes in-person or online courses, online practice labs and skill badges, and practice questions. The courses recommended for the Professional Cloud Architect certification include: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure, Architecting with Google Compute Engine, Architecting with Google Cloud: Design and Process, Getting Started with Google Kubernetes Engine, and Logging, Monitoring and Observability in Google Cloud.
> You’ll learn more about how these courses relate to the sections of the exam guide as you complete the modules in this course. You can take these as instructor-led courses or as on-demand courses on Coursera, Pluralsight, or Google Cloud Skills Boost. Keep in mind, that Architecting with Compute Engine, is available on-demand as a three-course series. You should take all three courses: Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation, Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services,
> Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation. for the equivalent content to the 3-day instructor-led course. Also, please note that the instructor-led course Architecting with Google Cloud: Design and Process is available in an on-demand format as Reliable Cloud Infrastructure: Design and Process. Skill badges provide hands-on experience working in Google Cloud. Skill badges are learning paths consisting of labs that give you hands-on practice with Google Cloud services or solutions.
> Pass the challenge lab at the end of the skill badge, and you receive a shareable credential that recognizes your ability to solve real-world problems with your cloud knowledge. As we review the diagnostic questions in this course, you’ll also get recommendations for skill badges to include in your study plan. During the certification exam, some of the questions may refer you to a case study that describes a fictitious business and solution concept. These case studies are intended to provide additional context as you answer the questions.
> You can access the official case studies from the exam guide. Before you take the certification exam, review the case studies that may be used to familiarize yourself with the requirements described in each. You should design a solution for each of them and learn in detail about the resources you would use in each of their environments. This will help you answer the portion of the exam that directly relates to those case studies and ensure that you understand the services and options that you may find detailed questions
> about in the rest of the exam. The case studies follow a similar format. Each one includes a company overview, a description of the solution concept, information about the existing technical environment, lists that outline business and technical requirements, and an executive statement that highlights priorities and challenges. In Module 6, you’ll walk through the process of analyzing a case study in detail.
> We’ll use Dress4Win, a case study from a previous version of the exam, as an example case study to examine the process. The Dress4Win case study is in your workbook. Before you take the exam, we recommend that you follow a similar process to review each of the official case studies. Sample questions are another resource you can use to prepare. The diagnostic questions in this course are designed to help you identify your knowledge gaps. On the certification page, Google provides a different set of sample questions that can
> help you familiarize yourself with the format of the exam questions. After you complete the question set, you will receive feedback describing the rationale for the correct answers. The sample questions provide a good opportunity to practice taking the type of scenario-based, application-level questions on the exam. The exam questions provide you with a scenario, explain the goal or what you are trying to achieve, and ask you what you would do in that situation. Google also supplies official public documentation for its products and services.
> This documentation is available at cloud.google.com/docs. In each of the following modules, you’ll learn about specific documentation resources to help you study that section in preparation for the exam.
