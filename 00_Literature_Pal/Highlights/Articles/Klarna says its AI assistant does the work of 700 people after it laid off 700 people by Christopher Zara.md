summary:: Klarna, a Swedish fintech company that faced criticism for laying off 700 employees, is now highlighting the efficiency of its AI assistant powered by OpenAI. The virtual assistant handles customer communications, enhances shopper satisfaction, and contributes to better financial outcomes. Klarna estimates that the chatbot could boost profits by $40 million in 2024 and has expanded its AI offerings globally to cover various tasks, including customer service. Despite the controversy surrounding the layoffs, Klarna asserts that its AI assistant is equivalent to the work of 700 full-time human agents, emphasizing the growing role of AI in improving company operations and customer interactions.
