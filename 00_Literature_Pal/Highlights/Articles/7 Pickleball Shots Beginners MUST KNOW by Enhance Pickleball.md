> oh in this video I'm going to give you the tools to play better pickleball if you're watching this I assume that you're someone who's looking to improve but to be the best possible player you need to have a crystal clear understanding of all the shots that we're about to go through if you're just getting started then these shots will be fundamental and helping you break that beginner hump if you're a more experienced player think of this video as a checkup to make sure that you have all these in your toolbox there's one shot in here that I've never talked about before on the channel so
> make sure to stay tuned if you're a beginner this has probably happened to you you're standing at the kitchen line falling like a pro when all of a sudden the other team lobs and the ball goes straight over your head you stick your paddle up in the air but it's already too late you try to run for the ball but at this point it's so far away that not even Usain Bolt could get there quickly enough don't worry though it's very common for beginner players to have trouble defending lobs what you need to figure out is a shot called the overhead or the smash the overhead smash looks something like this
> the two main areas that players get wrong are their overheads is how they hit the ball and how they move to the ball when you hit your overhead you want to start with your shoulders turned and your elbow back like you're throwing a ball this will give you way more power do not pan kick it like this if the ball is behind you you'll actually need to turn and run like this put that all together and you'll be smashing overheads like it's nobody's business so as a quick question which one of these is the proper form correct here I have my elbow back and
> I'm using the right footwork because it's so hard for players to respond to lobs the lob is a shot that I want to make sure you have in your toolbox there's no better feeling than getting the ball over your opponent's head and watching them turn and run like chickens just know that if you're playing with older players or people who can't move very quickly this shot can literally be a game changer be careful though not to use it too much or your partners may stop responding to your messages asking them to play when it comes to lobbing just know that you'll have more success the closer you're standing to the kitchen if you're
> all the way at the back of the Court lobs can still work but you don't have quite as good of an angle and your opponents will have more time to react looking at the height of the lob try to go just high enough to where they can't reach it if you go too high then it'll give them more time to back up and use an overhead and don't use this plate too often or your opponents will get used to it think of it as more of a surprise attack so for a quick rapid fire question where's the best spot in the court to hit a lob from correct the kitchen line if you and your opponents are at the kitchen light then you have the best possible angle to make the ball go over their head this neck
> shot though is the number one thing that I see beginners messing up if your serve looks something like this or this or this and it makes you feel like this that I'm here to help just know that a good toss will be the number one thing that makes your serving consistent try not to toss it up in the air so that you have to chase it instead base your hand down and drop the ball straight into your ideal contact point in terms of how to hit the serve the main serves that I see players switching between are the Hard Top Spin the screwball and the
> lobster just know that most players see the hard tops can serve as the default option the number one determinant to your success in your serve though is your deck the further you can get the ball in the court the more difficult it will be for your opponents to the good return so for our next rapid fire question which of these serves showcase me using the right tossing technique correct in this video I'm dropping the ball straight to the center of my paddle which allows me to consistently make clean contact with the ball but while serving is super important one of the
> most neglected shots that I see in pickleball is the return the biggest mistake that pickleball players make in their returns is they hit them exactly the same way they hit their ground strokes do not do this because the serve is already coming at you pretty fast there's no need to take a big swing this will only make it harder to time the ball you should try to use a blocking motion like this also you should try to have your body weight going forward through the ball moving forward through the ball will help you get more power and it'll also make it easier to immediately get to the kitchen line if you're just starting out it's important
> to remember that the goal after the return is get to the kitchen line immediately the longer that takes you to get there the easier making the third shot for your opponents so remember to always try and get to the kitchen line as quickly as you can and as a rapid fire question I want to ask you guys where you think the best spot to hit your return is correct you want to go deep as a bonus tip it can also help to try and aim for the weaker player on the other team and if you're just getting started on your pickleball Journey you're in the right place studying the game like this will Skyrocket your results I make a new
> informative video just like this every week so make sure to subscribe so that you're notified think of how much better you'll be in six months when you have that much more knowledge for the game and trust me if you think pickleball is fun now just wait till you're winning more and beating all your friends just like I do I've literally just beat you right before this cut cut but in my opinion guys the most important skills to develop when you're starting off are strong volleys and quick reactions you should be able to go this fast at the net just kidding but it'll help you a ton to be able to handle harder shots at the kitchen it's also crucial to know where
> to place your volleys when you're out the kitchen I see so many Rec players at our facility that look shocked when a Hardball gets hit at them you want your opponents to feel like they're playing a brick wall that they can't get anything by the first step to doing that is having a strong riding position with your paddle out in front like this always be in this position with a wide base and with bent knees you also need to make sure that you have the right grip most players use the Continental grip on their volleys which keeps their paddle perfectly up and down in the center of their body your forehead and backhand volley should be hit on
> opposite sides of the paddle you don't want to use the windshield wiper technique which looks like this this grips put you in the best possible position to react in terms of where you should hit the ball if your opponents are back it's your job to try and keep them back do this by hitting deep Ballers to them right at their feet if they're up you can stun them by going at the right shoulder down the middle or at their feet you always want to be intentional with your end position and where you're aiming your volleys and as a bonus tip who do you think should take this volley in the middle here correct this player the player who will
> have a forehand should take the ball in the middle since most players are usually righty that will generally be the person sitting on the left side next up we have the infamous third shot in pickleball well the shot that the serving team hits after the return if you've watched high level pickleball then you may have seen something like this Pro Baltimore Country Club and then like why wouldn't anyone ever hit the ball so slow most beginners generally try to go really hard on their third shot which looks something like this as someone who came from tennis all I
> wanted to do was hit every ball as hard as I could when I started it wasn't until I got wrecked by two of my mom's friends that I knew I needed to change my tennis ways just know that the two main types o
