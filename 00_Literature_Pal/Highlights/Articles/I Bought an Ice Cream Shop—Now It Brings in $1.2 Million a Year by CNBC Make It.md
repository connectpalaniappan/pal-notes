> the reality of owning a small business is not as glamorous as most people may assume it's hard and it's stressful there's a lot on the line especially when you have debt involved when you're trying to expand when you're putting all of the capital back into your business it's a challenge to look forward into the future and not get anxiety from the unknown
> I'm Sean Allard I'm 27 years old I own novel ice cream in Arizona and my business brought in $1.2 million in sales in [Music] 2023 we have two locations in Arizona one in downtown Phoenix and the other in downtown Mesa I decided to buy novel ice cream back in July of 2023 before buying novel ice cream I was Dental Consulting for
> about 3 and 1/2 years wanted to jump into a creative industry and ultimately serve a a good product this is a Cookie Monster cone with Fruity Pebbles this goes for $450 this is our staple our D melt it's an ice cream stuffed donut this here is only $4.95 the blueberry sorbet so this is our single cone this is only 3.95 I planned on going to dental school um and I worked with dentists for most of my
> postgraduate career so it's uh sort of ironic that we took a full 360 and are now working in uh the environment that may cause people to go to the dentist this is our headquarters this is right down the street like 2 or 3 minutes down the road and uh this is where we house all of our ice cream paper products supplies this is where we deliver
> everything from every morning as well right so we've broken down the warehouse into a few different sections we've got all of our cups and some of our beverages over here we've got kind of our utility desk here all of our beverages for both shops and then we have a ton of General toppings cones syrups things like that over here and then if you jump back here you have all
> of our ice cream I bought novel ice cream in August of 2023 for about $1.1 million I used an SBA loan and put 10% down using family capital I took home $0 in net income in 2023 and lived primarily off of savings to reinvest back into the business and looking at 2024 we're projected to do $1.3 million in sales and I will take home about $40,000 in net
> income he just got here we're going to move some stuff okay all right talk to you there yeah bye up good you yeah good I went to my family and presented them the opportunity to buy novel ice cream they really like the idea and so my parents loaned me that $110,000 and over the next 5 years I hope to pay that
> 110,000 plus interest uh back to them a lot of the things that happen inside and outside of the shop would be extremely extremely expensive uh if I didn't have the support around me I consider myself extremely extremely lucky to be in a position where my family would graciously offer to support me and that way and help
> build a family business together this just like so much so much so this is called the green belt in downtown Mesa we have a few shops down this Corridor right here you see our second location that opened back in 2019 how's the ice cream was great good what'd you get I got a raspberry heck yeah thank you guys you guys so much for
> coming I appreciate you have a good day guys thank you for stopping by thank you have a good rest of your day as of today we have 20 team members broken up between shops at around 10 each our gross margin sits between 35 and 37% our profit margin sits between 2 and 4% due to all the capital that we're reinvesting into growth we get ice cream deliveries on a weekly basis we have a separate ice cream uh manufa vuring
> facility so this is our delivery van this delivers everything out of our headquarters to both of our shops so we deliver ice cream on a daily basis donuts and all of our paper products to both of our shops this is our bag of ice cream pans uh usually we have two bags per shop so we have each individual pan in here [Music]
> so this is a dozen of our uncut Donuts this is our well-known ice cream stuffed doughnut these are picked up from a separate manufacturing facility on a daily basis so these were made about an hour ago so in Arizona around this time it starts getting pretty hot as you can see the sun is out right now it's about 90° and about about 2 to 3 weeks from now we're
> probably going to hit around 100 110° in the summer months it's a little unbearable to be outside so we do slow down a little bit from July to August our busiest months are actually October through December and then starting back up again in March through [Music] May we are going to be moving some stuff to our third location which is being built out right now it's a trailer so this is our third location uh this is a
> a fixed trailer that we're putting up in downtown Poria which is the west side of Phoenix uh this is 20 ft hopefully have everything installed within the next month and a half or so to open up middle uh of July the cost of this trailer specifically is around $28 to $30,000 all in with equipment and everything we should hope to close this thing out at about $35 to $40,000 many many many many hours a day of just
> ordering and placing and pivoting trying to figure out how all this stuff is going to fit in a 20ft trailer all that stuff it's fun on a day-to-day basis this game is very or bus business in general is
> stressful it is hard but that is what comes with the territory and again no matter what the size of the business is you are going to face those challenges people problems product quality problems whatever it may be it's always going to be hard so wrapping your head around that reality is going to make your day-to-day a lot easier versus trying to expect things to
> go a certain way
