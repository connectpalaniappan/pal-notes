summary:: First-principles thinking involves breaking down complex problems to their basic elements and rebuilding from scratch. Elon Musk exemplifies this approach to challenge conventional thinking and unlock new possibilities. By reasoning from first principles, we can free ourselves from limiting assumptions and tap into our creative potential.

> Socratic Questioning
> Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and normal discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. Socratic questioning generally follows this process:
> 1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
> 2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
> 3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
> 4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
> 5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
> 6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
> This process stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts

> lot of professional investors read Farnam Street. When I meet these people and ask how they consume information, they usually fall into one of two categories. The differences between the two apply to all of us. The first type of investor says there is too much information to consume. They spend their days reading every press release, article, and blogger commenting on a position they hold. They wonder what they are missing. The second type of investor realizes that reading everything is unsustainable and stressful and makes them prone to overvaluing information they’ve spent a great amount of time consuming. These investors, instead, seek to understand the variables that will affect their investments. While there might be hundreds, there are usually three to five variables that will really move the needle. The investors don’t have to read everything; they just pay attention to these variables.

- [n] Am in the first group, trying to read everything and over-value information I know of. 
   Need to move to the second group where I know the variables I need to focus on. For example, I can be reading every article I save. I need to focus on system design and data structures. So those would be the variable I need to shortlist and focus on.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfrwf78k1krk765m01v6vkr)

> Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true.[[11]](https://fs.blog/first-principles/#_ftn11) We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for ourselves. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible.

> “I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can,” says Musk. “They sell themselves short without trying. One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”

- [n] You need to hold to the big branches i.r. fundamentals. Holding on to the leaves will kill you on the long run.
   Another way is to learn about the fundamentals by traversing from the leaves.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htgz031b9y23tt3k28jsqy78)
