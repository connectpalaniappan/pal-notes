summary:: At Prime Video, they improved their audio/video monitoring service by moving from a distributed system to a single process, reducing costs by over 90%. This change allowed them to handle thousands of streams efficiently and increase their scaling capabilities. By migrating to a monolith architecture, they achieved significant cost savings and improved the quality of customer experience.
