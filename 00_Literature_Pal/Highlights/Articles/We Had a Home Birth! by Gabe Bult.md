> I wait a minute we had a baby actually exactly where you're standing so I know you guys probably have a lot of questions like why do you have so many meal worms are you eating your creatine and the answer is no we haven't been sleeping a ton we we have two kids under two but I guess that does lead to the question of uh why did you decide to have a home birth cuz I hate hospitals you can't say that uh because I had such a good experience with Laura at the birth center and wanted to take it up a notch by
> doing it at home she's awake oh my goodness is a train record so for everybody who is probably wondering uh what was that like what was that like it it wasn't too bad for me it was fast I almost had to catch him it was incredibly fast I think when did the labor start almost 7:00 it's like 7:00 it started and he was born

> 9:30 9:30 9:30
> [Music] for and The Midwives arrived like half an hour before he was born yeah so I was this close to catching him which uh would have been exciting that would have been a good video we had the birth right here we put down a mattress and some different stuff that you put down for home births plastic tarp and some Chuck pads that I think a lot of people thought we were going to die uh the amount people the amount of people that
> tried to talk me out of having a home birth because they didn't feel like I was safe was ridiculous obviously there are a ton of great things um at hospitals for a lot of people but um there's also a lot of really good benefits from having a birth at home I think it was a really cool personal experience we're both here in the most comfortable place in the world which is our own house no beeping no monitors no anything like that surrounded by people that we know and trusted the midwives that you've known for years we were able
> to be together and then once he was born we were able to chill out for like 45 minutes and then go to bed in our own bed which was super cool like you said like there's a lot of good stuff in hospitals and it's true there is a lot of good stuff in hospitals but I feel like a lot of people are afraid of Home births even if they're not highrisk and I'm not highrisk even our highrisk pregnancy wasn't High I wasn't high risk Michael was high risk um but both of these two Laura and Thomas been toally really healthy pregnancies have been
> great so there's there's no danger of me having the babies at home nobody was scared nobody was stressed out well you might have been a little stressed out with the thought of having to catch him but that's the thing though like it would have been fine like if I had to catch him like literally it would have been fine so what was the pain like you were able to walk up the stairs 45 minutes after having him but yeah I mean obviously during labor that's not fun like it was so much shorter than Laura's that I didn't even have time to like register that oh this hurts like it hurt
> but it wasn't like with Laura had a lot more time to think about the pain cuz hers was 12 hours especially afterwards the pain wasn't that bad and I feel like a lot of it had to do with just the fact that I was home and I was comfortable for those of you wondering how much a home birth costs it costs 4,500 but because it's our second birth only four grand I don't know how does that relate to a hospital I honestly don't know uh I don't I don't know what a hospital birth up here would be for a healthy baby but for Michael it ended up being 15 grand at of pocket and that's with really good
> insurance before we introduce you uh if you guys want to see more stuff on babies uh Meredith has a bunch of videos on um motherhood and about the baby and stuff like that so if you want to hear more about this check out her Channel link down below Laura got to meet him the next day hi buddy that's your baby yeah is he cute yeah we're like 15 hours in and we still don't know what color his eyes are cuz he won't open them long enough for us to tell blue or brown
> pretty sure so this is Thomas he was born 8 lb 15 o 22 in long he's got my nose he likes long naps and lots of milk cheers buddy so yeah guess that's it see you next week hello
