> how do I know which Gateway cities to search you want to search the Hub cities of the airline for example with the American Airlines you want to go to Peru going to South America their hubs would be Dallas and Miami that would be a good place to start in theoria could be anywhere going to Asia if they don't have the flights out of New York American Airlines has a Hub in Chicago they have a hub in LA and of course Dallas but it's not just the gateways for American think about Japan Airlines you would look up what cities they fly to in North America they have a flight to China via to
> out of one of those cities it wouldn't be too hard for you to get yourself on a separate ticket to one of those cities
