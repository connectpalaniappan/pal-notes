> Music] brought to you by the every dooll app start budgeting for free today my question is how should I feel about a prenup I know your stance on prenups and I know kind of um you know extreme circumstances and I believe kind of like my circumstance is kind of extreme on both ends so a little bit about my background I'm currently 28 I follow the baby steps through and through currently on 3B I make about 300,000 a year
> and uh that's divided up into about 100K in retirement 100K for a down payment and you know 25 to 35,000 and just a bank account checking account for an emergency fund so um my question so I'm getting married in June to my wonderful fiance um and her family is extremely wealthy and although I do not and her her parents and grandparents are
> extremely wealthy so uh they are apparently I'm I'm supposed to be signing a prenup um obviously before the marriage and kind of we're going to go over that and my question to you is how should I feel about that as well as um you know what to look for in a prenup like what I don't I don't necessarily know what questions to ask my lawyer and just one last thing is my income could be going from you know to 400 500 plus
> over the next two to three years uh annually so yeah that would be my question yeah wow how old is your fiance she is I am 28 she is 25 does she have any money no you didn't ask and you didn't ask her for a prenup I have not the prup the prenup was for the potential inheritance the prenup is for the potential inheritance I have not had a sit down to disc when did the prenup
> discussion come up after you were engaged it was after we were engaged uh yes but I kind of had an idea like I mean they are I don't know the specifics on their net worth but I they are extremely extremely wealthy yeah okay so all right um I you know the only way I know how to answer a question is uh what would I do if I woke up in your shoes Okay um so um when my children
> were married my net worth was in excess of $100 million already at that point um and none of them signed a prup and we didn't and we didn't ask them to none of my son none of my in-laws son a PR up and we didn't ask him to now I have my estate plan set up to where certain things are controlled only by Ramsey blood in trusts so you can't get to them in the event of a divorce uh thing number one one thing
> number two I I just not that guy so uh I'm not worried about it um this is God's money I'm managing it I figure he he can take care of it um I understand their concern uh if you were um you know if you're making 30,000 bucks a year or something uh it would be more of a concern but it's you know um I it's uh frankly it's a little bothersome
> um if I'm in your shoes um and not enough to cancel the whole thing but it it's troubling uh that these people uh obviously they want to protect what they built and make sure it goes to their kids let me ask you here's another thing I would want to find out and I don't know in Most states uh the divorce stuff we've been involved in on the financial side an inh amount of inheritance generally in the event of a divorce goes to the person that inherited the money they don't
> split it in Most states so if you inherit your mama's house and you get a divorce you get your mama's house you don't split it with your ex in Most states okay now I don't know Missouri law and I'm not a lawyer uh but i' I've experienced that in you know being called in in the middle of divorce situations where we're helping negotiate and all that I've experienced that to be the facts that the judge uh or the statutes award that that way so I I would learn about that in Missouri
> um number one they may have that protection built into the law is what I'm saying um and then you've just got to decide how much you care about this issue um because I don't think um and what this issue means what does it mean to your relationship what does it mean to the uh the family you are marrying because you're marrying her and her family and so um you know it's really low class that this came up after you made a contract to get married they
> bring up oh but by the way after you've gotten a contract to get married called getting engaged uh we're going to add something to the terms of the contract after you've already signed it that's low class I'm curious Josh what does your fiance think how does she feel about this is she completely in line with the parents or does it make her feel weird what's going on here to be honest I mean she she's you know she's the oldest of four
> total and they're they're awesome family super downto Earth people but they you know they've not you know never really had to work or you know you're not answering my question and you're being really nice because you're a classy dude I'm going somewhere with this how does she feel about it when it came up what was her comment on this deal she I mean she understands she understands it I mean she that what I was getting at is she just doesn't really have like she doesn't know so
> she's okay with it my point is it wasn't a head tilt or or or a red flag or yellow flag it was just like oh okay is that what I'm hearing she does what she's told exactly yes help she listens to her parents yeah she listens to her that makes this relationally a little bit more difficult you know had she had the same feeling the yucky feeling you had I assume you have a yucky feeling about it is that or am I am I making the wrong assumption well I just like go back to what you guys feel about prenups and it it is an extreme situation but like I I
> don't you know is yeah it doesn't feel good like do I need to do anything on my end what else is going to come up after you're married that they tell her what to do well the one other thing was exactly yeah the one other thing is apparently they're so so the family is are in development so they're big into real estate and they they build houses and and have a lot of land another thing is apparently they're going to be building us a house and and putting it in a trust to where we don't have a
> payment apparently and yeah this has all been decided apparently wait a minute this is my freaking house there's no apparently yeah I'm involved in the decision I think this ought to be premarital counseling I bring it up with your I'm shooting up flares now I think the two of you need to sit down with a Prem marage counseling and you're getting married in June this is um this family has uh problems with leaving and cleaving yeah that's right Ken I know
> this about me I really like to be in control I think that's a fair assessment yeah I know this about me and I know this about wealth yeah that as you add wealth it makes you more of what you already are and so having some money has given me the ability to control a lot of things in my life yeah the variables I don't have cars that break down anymore because they're nice
> ones I used to drive crap when I was broke and I was broke down on the side of the crappy Road in the crappy car and my crappy life and I hated it I hated it CU I felt out of control and desperate and freaked out and so now I drive cars that don't break because I got some money by doing the stuff we teach here and I also know that that control in that sense controlling the variables control the controllables that's a good feature but I'm also well aware that it can be a bad feature
> yep you you've probably seen that uh I cannot recall oh I cannot recall you are so full of crap well that's also a great demonstration on what you do in that situation just go Congress act like a congressman I cannot recall do nothing yeah no I no it also yes and but but in in a situation like that where we've seen it it you snap back CU you are healthy Point you're making is what I had to face the hardest parenting I've ever done in my life the hard cuz when
> they're little you just freaking tell them what to Doh and if you don't do what I say to do I'll take you out and make another one look just like you okay so you're going to do what I say to do I'm in charge the inmates are not in charge of the Asylum when they're like grown and paying their own bills and stuff you don't
