summary:: The text discusses the balance between first principles thinking and pattern matching in decision-making processes. It explores the idea that both forms of thinking are necessary for good reasoning and emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between the two modes. The text also delves into how first principles thinking can fail, highlighting scenarios where reasoning from the wrong set of true principles can lead to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, the text mentions the significance of considering all relevant information and adjusting one's thinking when new information is presented.

> The question is interesting because many career decisions depend on good thinking, and thinking is split roughly into pattern matching against our experiences, or reasoning from first principles. My belief is that it isn’t enough to have one or the other; you really need to have both

> I talked about the danger of using frameworks excessively. I argued that frameworks are compelling because they help give order to your world, but that they also colour and shape (and sometimes blind you to) what you see around you.

> We all know stories of those who pattern matched against the past, only to discover that their matches were wrong when applied to the future

> One lazy answer is that pattern matching is often fast, whereas analysis isn’t, and so pattern matching is better suited for situations where you have to make a decision quickly

> edge case more than it is an interesting answer — we know that pattern matching may also be employed in slower, more considered forms of thinking: psychologists call this analogical reasoning

> Another possible answer is that you make a mistake when executing your reasoning:
> • One or more of your ‘principles’ or ‘axioms’ turns out to be mistaken.
> • You make a mistake in one of your inference steps

> What is interesting to me are the instances when you’ve built logically coherent propositions from true and right axioms, *and you still get things wrong anyway*.

> Today, I know that you can build analyses up from base principles … only to end up at the wrong level of abstraction. This is one way to fail at first principles thinking.

> I think there's a more pernicious form of failure, which occurs when you reason from the *wrong set of true principles*. It is pernicious because you can’t easily detect the flaws in your reasoning. It is pernicious because all of your base axioms are true.

> you pick the wrong set of base principles — even if they’re all true — you are likely to end up with the wrong conclusion at the end of your thinking. In other words, the only real test you have is against reality. Your conclusion should be useful. It should produce effective action.

- [n] You need to be validating your principle and patterns again and again against reality to check your conclusions were right or wrong.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj1hb9f29hg4hcm6rt6rfg4)

> To paraphrase that aphorism: in theory, first principles thinking always leads you to the right answer. In practice, it doesn't.
