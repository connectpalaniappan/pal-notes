summary:: Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI tools that can understand and generate text for various tasks. They are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and can be fine-tuned for specific applications with minimal additional training. Google Cloud offers resources to help developers create and deploy LLMs for different uses, like chatbots and search engines.

> what are large language models large language models refer to large general purpose language models that can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes

> these models are trained for general purposes to solve common language problems such as text classification question answering document summarization and text generation across Industries the models can then be tailored to solve specific problems in different fields such as Retail Finance and entertainment using a relatively small size of field data sets

- [n] Generative AI is to take a generic problem which is common to all industries and tailor it specific to an industry  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j7fheqamp0hbqjf6yx03achy)

> large indicates two meanings first is the enormous size of the training data set sometimes at the pedy scale second it refers to the parameter count in machine learning parameters are often called hyperparameters parameters are basically the memories and the knowledge the machine learned from the model training parameters

> general purpose general purpose is when the models are sufficient to solve common problems two reasons led to this idea first is the commonality of human language regardless of the specific tasks

> pre-train a large language model for a general purpose with a large data set and then find tune it with specific aims with a much smaller data set

> f shot refers to training a model with minimal data and zero shot implies that a model can recognize things that have not explicitly been taught in the training

> llm development you don't need to be an expert you don't need training examples and there is no need to train a model
> all you need to do is think about prompt design which is a process of creating a prompt that is clear concise and informative it is an important part of natural language processing or NLP for short

> in traditional machine learning you need expertise training examples compute time and Hardware that's a lot more requirements than llm developmen

> prompt design fancy prompt design and prompt engineering are two closely related Concepts in natural language processing both involve the process of creating a prompt that is clear concise and informative

> prompt design is a more General concept while prompt engineering is a more specialized concept
> prompt design is essential while prompt engineering is only necessary for systems that require a high degree of accuracy or performance
