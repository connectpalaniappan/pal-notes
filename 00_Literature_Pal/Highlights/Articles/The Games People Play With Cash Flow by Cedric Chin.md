summary:: The author discusses the concept of cash flow and how it is often more important than profits in managing a business. They give examples of different ways people play games with cash flow, such as leveraging debt and pre-payments. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding cash flow and its implications when considering raising capital for a business. They argue that raising capital is a result of the temporality of cash flows and is dependent on the specific business model.

> People with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.

> • The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.
> • Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.

- [n] For a business with recurring income and high upfront cost, taking debt and not paying tax is the best strategy.  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj3fc95ff88rrdv2hkbhzkd)

> The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.

> Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.

> After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.

- [n] Just curious, how did Malone pull the company out from the brink of failure ?  * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj3kd45ae1mhj43qekb9fjd)

> First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber base.

> TCI had high interest payments and big write-offs on cable equipment, it produced losses, and because it produced losses it paid hardly any taxes to the government.

> In SaaS businesses — like Slack, or Zoom — you pay programmers to create software, and then you pay even more money to sales and marketing to land customers. Then the customers pay you a stable stream of cash for years and years afterwards. Same dynamics: high upfront costs, and then a stable stream of comparatively smaller payments later. So while SaaS companies don’t typically use debt the way Malone did, they have — surprise, surprise! — [similar capital requirements](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-economics-1/).)

> You’re running a completely bootstrapped business, which means you earn what you can sell. A huge chunk of your capital is locked up in inventory. Now your boss needs that cash back, to pay for expenses. You should view the discount he’s giving to customers as a price he’s willing to pay … *in order to unlock that cash flow*.”
