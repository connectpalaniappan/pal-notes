> all right okay the internet is cool no just kidding the internet is awful but you know what's worse programmer communities and we're starting at the core of this brain rot Tech YouTube there's an old saying for every Vim using Chad there's an equal and opposite VSS code Guru ready to sell you a course if you're getting programming advice and bro's hair looks like this may God have mercy more affiliate links than GitHub repos more experience yapping on YouTube than writing actual code the irony of a guru selling aam they aren't even
> pursuing most of this content makes zero sense programming is not enough what what the no other occupation has this accountants accounting that's enough chefs cooking that's cool pakistanis and Indians beefing that's expected programmers programming hell no man what the man this when these guys aren't being highly original on YouTube they're probably on the next Community Tech Twitter there's only two words I can use to describe Tech Twitter open defecation build a public learn in
> public defecate in public you're not a solo preneur bro you're unemployed your SAS product is cloud storage E-Waste you're Indie hacking yourself to homelessness moving to Asia with a Macbook and saying the American dream is dead oh the West has fallen yeah that's not a personality trait it's called skill issue for the actual content itself it's not that much different to the rest of Twitter if it's not rage bait it's hot takes if it's not hot takes it's Boomer yelling at clouds or my personal favorite the junior Dev motivational spe speaker but at least
> Twitter users try and make their own content imagine a place where the content is Twitter screenshots with a superiority complex programming Reddit on a platform with such amazing communities boy this is somehow the worst it used to be a place where you could talk resumÃ©s interviews promotions you know career questions nowadays it's a bunch of doomers that feel entitled to Google salaries with Udi level skills there's always something new to Doom about like layoffs mediocre AI ADHD
