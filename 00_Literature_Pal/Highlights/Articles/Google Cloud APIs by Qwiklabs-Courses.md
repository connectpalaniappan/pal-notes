summary:: Google Cloud services can be accessed through APIs, which provide a clean and well-defined interface for developers to interact with. By using Google's Cloud Client and API Client Libraries available in various languages, developers can easily control Google Cloud services without starting from scratch. The Google APIs Explorer tool helps developers explore available APIs and versions within the Google Cloud console.

> The third way to access Google Cloud is through application programming interfaces, or APIs. A software service’s implementation can be complex and changeable. If each software service had to be coded for each implementation, the result would be brittle and error-prone. So instead, application developers structure the software they write in a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless detail, and then they document that interface. That’s an Application Programming Interface.
> The underlying implementation can change as long as the interface doesn’t, and other pieces of software that use the API don’t have to know or care. The services that make up Google Cloud offer APIs so that code you write can control them. The Google Cloud console includes a tool called the Google APIs Explorer that shows what APIs are available, and in what versions. Suppose you’ve explored an API, and you’re ready to build an application that uses it.
> Do you have to start coding from scratch? No. Google provides Cloud Client and Google API Client Libraries in many popular languages to take much of the drudgery out of the task of calling Google Cloud from your code. Languages currently represented in these libraries are: Java, Python, PHP, C#, Go, Node.js, Ruby and C++.
