summary:: Reddit is like the front page of the Internet. It hosts billions of posts. And a lot many of these posts contain media content such as images, videos, gifs, and so on. While the media content is often stored in object storage, the metadata is different. For example, if youâ€™ve got a video, you might need to store information such as the thumbnail URL, playback URLs, bitrates, and various resolutions.
