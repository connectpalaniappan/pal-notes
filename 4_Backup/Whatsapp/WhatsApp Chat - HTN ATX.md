[1/16/24, 10:13:13 PM] ‪+1 (303) 960‑2699‬: Long life can be a curse. Death is a great relief. Death is not that wonderful old man on the buffalo, you see, Yama Dharma. He comes to say, "Enough! Come with me." Like a mother goes to school to bring her child out; of course the child wants to continue to play. It says, "School is over, now I want to play." Mummy says, "No darling, you must come home." 

Yama is like that. And of course in spirituality there is no Yama. When we die, Master Himself comes to take us. And when you say, "Master is with me. I feel His presence all the time," and when He comes, why are you afraid? "No, no sir, He doesn't come to take me to Shahjahanpur. I don't know where He will take me." Then where have you been wanting to go in spirituality? So you have to think you see. "No sir, I have faith in the Master, but you know, I have suffered a loss. I don't know how to continue to have faith."

So faith does not mean we will be successful in life; faith does not mean that we will not be sick. It does not mean anything. It only means - I have faith. I have faith in Him who is my beloved, my Master. He can do nothing which is bad for me, though it may appear to me bad. So, that faith can only give us courage.

[3/25/24, 9:11:27 AM] ‪+1 (512) 553‑6006‬: The statement implies that because our lives are filled with real and meaningful experiences, we should not be afraid of death, which is a natural part of life. It encourages us to embrace life to the fullest, recognizing death as just another facet of our overall journey, not as something to dread. This is just my understanding.  Looking for other interpretation from others 🙏

Premiere on Mar 27, 2024. YT Link:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vvYyMJGpP_U&feature=youtu.be

Here's a short trailer: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C49iyBYLjXI/?igsh=MTZ0OWdiNDdqampjaw==
[3/26/24, 3:52:15 PM] ‪+1 (512) 581‑5107‬: Thanks, brother.
[3/26/24, 3:52:17 PM] ‪+1 (512) 581‑5107‬: In this context, "life in life" refers to the idea that life is not just a series of external events or experiences but also an inner journey of growth, transformation, and self-discovery. It's the recognition that life is happening within us as much as around us.

This includes unfolding our inner potential, evolving our consciousness, and deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world. It's a journey that takes place within the depths of our being, where we confront our fears, desires, hopes, and dreams and discover our true nature and purpose.

Essentially,  it points to the idea that life is a multidimensional, dynamic, and constantly evolving process encompassing our existence's outer and inner aspects.
[3/26/24, 3:52:46 PM] ‪+1 (512) 581‑5107‬: If we understand that life is not just the physical existence but also the inner journey and the essence of our being, then fearing death becomes less rational. Here are some reasons why:

1. Impermanence is natural: Everything in life, including our physical bodies, is impermanent. When we accept this, we can see death as a natural part of the cycle of life.
2. True self is eternal: If we identify with our true self, which is the essence of our being, then we realize that it is infinite and cannot be harmed by physical death.
3. Fear is an illusion: Fear of death is often fueled by our imagination and ego. When we let go of these, we see that fear is an illusion and death is just a transition.
4. Life is in the present: By focusing on the present moment and living fully, we can transcend the fear of death and appreciate the beauty of life as it unfolds.
5. Death is a transformation: Many spiritual traditions view death as a transition to another realm or a new stage of existence.

By understanding and internalizing these perspectives, we can reduce our fear of death and approach it with acceptance, peace, and joy.
