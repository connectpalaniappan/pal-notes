[3/22/24, 3:31:09 PM] Meyyapan Mama Amman Malaysia: I have checked with Muthuraman. They have done a search recently. Lot 11491 is still in your ayahs name. The land office had given me the wrong report earlier. You can inform your dad accordingly. In future anything we can deal directly with Muthuraman. I know him personally
[3/22/24, 7:08:46 PM] Palani aka Pal: Wow! Good news mama. Will let Appa know. Thank you so much for all your help.
[3/23/24, 3:32:53 AM] Meyyapan Mama Amman Malaysia: No problem.
