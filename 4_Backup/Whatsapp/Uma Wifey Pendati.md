[1/9/24, 10:35:58 PM] Palani aka Pal: Artic blast from this Friday... Here is your quick refresher course/tips to prepare for the upcoming artic blast.. just in case....
1. Drip all faucets . It’s even recommended to run an thin stream of water . 
2. Cover your external faucets with insulation covers . This you can buy in Home Depot 
    3 . Drain your hoses and sprinklers. Switch off water and run the sprinklers , this should drain them. 
4. Propane based stove or a small generator can help . 
5. Stock food that dosen't need heating up . 
6. Get Firewood just in case . 
7. Cover outdoor water softner exposed pipes and system with insulation material. Get electric hair dryer handy.
8. Stock up one of the bath tub(first floor only) full of water as this can be used for anything other than potable purposes
9. Stock up on water bottles or big containers of water in the kitchen for drinking and cooking purposes in case of no running water
10. Stock up on canned goods like channa, black beans, tomato paste etc so you can cook even if you don’t have electricity as you can light up the gas with a lighter or match stick
11. Stock on pantry stuff, especially bread, peanut butter, honey so you can make a sandwich in the stove or a cold sandwich
12. Some stock up on dry milk powder so you can still drink coffee, tea
13. You can get shelf stable almond milk for the kids and once opened you can leave it outside or in the garage as it will be like keeping in the fridge due to low temps
14. Do not open your refrigerator or freezer as every time you open it during no power it reduces the coolness. Without opening refrigerator will keep food good for 4 hours and a full freezer up-to 48 hours.
15. Keep the cabinets open in kitchen and bedroom for warmer air to circulate and keep the pipes from getting frozen
