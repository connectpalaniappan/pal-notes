Pongal Kids Ramp Walk:
We have 14 budding young (future Broadway) artists who will be entertaining us at the Pongal Ramp Walk personifying our cultural icons. They haven't revealed who they are, keeping it a surprise! 

PattiMandram:
We have an exciting Pattimandram panel lineup (please check out the poster below) ready to battle it out (They already have) leaving our Naduvar in dire straits. Check out their requests to Naduvar already.

Srini's Team: தந்தைக்கு உபதேசம் செய்த சாமிநாதனும், அவன் அன்னை உமையவளும் தமிழ் பக்கம் நிற்கயிலே திருவாழ்மார்பனுக்கு என்ன கவலை?! முத்தான தீர்ப்ப்பு ஒன்றை கொடு அண்ணாமலையாரே என்பது தான் எங்களது வேண்டுகோள்!

Sundar's Team: காந்தியே எங்கள் பக்கம் தான் இருக்கிறார் நடுவர் அவர்களே.... எனவே சத்தியத்திற்கு சோதனை தராமல் எங்கள் பக்கம் வந்து விடுங்கள்.

Group Games:

We have planned fun group games involving both kids and adults (Girls Vs Boys), involving movies, song trivia that will keep you engaged and entertained. Let's see who will score this one!

We must start the programs on time to avoid any delay in vacating the hall by 6 pm. If we run late, we may incur additional fees, so let's make an effort to stay on schedule. Also during Pattimandram, we request you bring any coloring pages & color supplies or other articles your kids like, to keep them engaged.

Celebration Attire
Please wear Indian Ethnic attire. Sarees and Veshtis are preferred. The weather forecast looks to be 54 degrees and Sunny. Please bring a jacket for the outdoor space. Keep in mind that kids should be supervised by parents in the outdoor area.

Get ready for a fun ride! You don't want to miss this one out. We have performers from ages 1 through 50+, who are ready to showcase their talents!

Thank you!

[2/6/24, 8:01:02 PM] Kumar Annan Personal Austin: Once a dog came in front of me while going on a scooter.. .... 
To save him I lost balance and the scooter fell into the drain beside the road... 
With a lot of difficulty, I came out of the drain...... 
Just then a beautiful woman stopped her car and asked: - Did it hurt too much ..... ❓
No.. No.. I replied..
She said:- My house is nearby, let's go and cleanup your clothes....... 
I said:- No, thank you very much, my wife will be angry..... 
Don't worry, I'm a doctor..... Let's go... 😀 she insisted and said
I want to see if you have a fracture.....? 

Actually she was "very beautiful" and good natured.... 

I couldn't say "no"... 

I said:- Okay, I'm coming but I'm sure my wife will be angry.. 
I went to her house and washed off my clothes, hands and legs and then she checked on me if I had any serious injuries? 
I drank cold juice and then said:- Now I am much better than before, but for sure my wife will get angry....I shud go now... 
She smiled and said:- Why so worried.......Your wife will not know anything, she must be sitting at home....... 
I said:- I dont think so... she may be still lying in the drain.......

[2/21/24, 6:53:19 AM] Ramki Annan Austin: Dear Austin Nagarathars,

Our region is slated to lead NSNA during the next term based on rotation policy.  However, Atlanta has expressed interest and is in the process of forming the core team.  They would be preferred over us if they come forward with the core team because they haven't led NSNA in the past.  Houston & Dallas have successfully led the NSNA in the past, and we would like to know if Austin is interested this time.

I've talked to a few of the Austin Nagarathars to see if there is widespread interest in Austin and would like to discuss with Dallas & Houston as well to take this process forward.  If you are interested then please form a core committee (President, Secretary & Treasurer), and let me know before 2/25/2024.  I can be reached at palaniappan.palaniappan@gmail.com or 281-409-8927.

Thanks
Palaniappan Palaniappan

I planned it two weeks in advance so we can get cheaper printing rates, I was able to print at $1.30/ print last year and was able to print 600 copies but this year I managed to find a printer for $0.32/ print. This means more copies for the same price. I am aiming for 1500 copies to be distributed across 5 temples on MahaSivarathri.So pls consider donating with the same Target of $600. 
Thank you all!
