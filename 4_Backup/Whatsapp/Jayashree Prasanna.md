[1/3/24, 6:27:03 PM] Jayashree Prasanna: One quick question, when you moved to Austin, did you take your test again for driving license?
[1/3/24, 7:59:50 PM] Palani aka Pal: You don't need to take the driving test when you have a valid California license
[1/3/24, 8:10:29 PM] Palani aka Pal: Though you need to take the computer exam i.e. multiple answer questions
[1/3/24, 9:23:04 PM] Jayashree Prasanna: Oh good 👍🏼
[1/4/24, 12:17:07 PM] Palani aka Pal: Sorry one wrong info. I did not take the computer exam as well. 

Just take an appointment now as the wait times are too long. And submit the needed documents during the visit. That's it.
[1/4/24, 1:28:00 PM] Jayashree Prasanna: Thank you Pals 😊
[3/18/24, 11:28:35 AM] Jayashree Prasanna: Hi Pals, would you like to have a LinkedIn premium for 2 months? I have a few coupons left and I had asked Uma as well
[3/18/24, 11:30:30 AM] Palani aka Pal: Thanks for asking. I don't need now Jayashree. Will start job search in a month or two. 

Will ask uma. ‎<This message was edited>
