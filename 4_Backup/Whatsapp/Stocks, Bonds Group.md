[1/31/24, 9:47:45 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Ai is the modern gold rush. 

Nvdia and AMD are making hay while the gold is shining.

I am long both but not enough to make too much hay!!

Nvda is valued at 1.6T today.   

SMCI says they have super duper chips and the stock is flying high.  So are others including Broadcom, 

ASML provides the shovels to Nvdia to make the shovels for the AI Gold Rush and so on.  

Are we overestimating Ai?

Like humans have historically overestimated many other things over time:

Gold rush
 
Pet rocks

Dutch Tulips

Dotcom and Networking

Blockchain and crypto

And now Ai.
[1/31/24, 9:49:54 PM] Mark Chockalingam: And what if we find out that Ai is really going to solve just very mundane problems with just reasonable ROIs not outrageous ROIs.  

I fear that this bubble may burst at the wrong time after companies have invested billions...
[1/31/24, 9:54:18 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Some of my tech friends staunchly believe Ai is going to do wonders and lift us up.   

Lift all of us or just people like Elon Musk only?!

Similarly tech engineers truly believed Y2K will disrupt the world and we may have to live in bunkers - a few even stored canned food in their basement in 1999.  Fun times to celebrate the New Year on Jan 1 2000 with the world still intact.  

Make hay but watch out as well!

My two cents
[1/31/24, 9:55:46 PM] Mark Chockalingam: At the height of the dotcom bubble Intel was valued at 500B now it is worth less than a third - this was the company that sold shovels to the dotcom kids!

[1/31/24, 11:29:04 PM] ‪+1 (214) 733‑4820‬: Spot on annan, AI is a hot topic these days, and many companies are investing in it, AI is still in its early stages of development and has a long way to go before it can match human intelligence. Even in its early stages, many companies, including OpenAI, are facing computing limitations. Getting a sufficient Open AI end points are becoming very tough. The next big thing will be Quantum....huge investments are made by Amazon, google and MSFT on these technologies. More than 60% AI companies will not be active in next 5 years 🙃
[1/31/24, 11:45:58 PM] ‪+1 (510) 386‑1430‬: I am on other side of shore. Believe in AI. Huge demand for two years is real. Current euphoria will find levels and stocks may correct but won’t bubble out.
[1/31/24, 11:55:57 PM] ‪+1 (510) 386‑1430‬: My opinions are based on:

Last weekend few of friends gathered to talk. One use case we came out is. AI evolving from text to video, once it is available. We already tried give some successful movie stories, AI produces new story. Feed that you will get a new movie. Sample…
[2/1/24, 12:08:49 AM] ‪+1 (510) 386‑1430‬: Fed one movie through Python script to open ai model and got this, find the movie what I gave?
[2/1/24, 12:08:53 AM] ‪+1 (510) 386‑1430‬: A young detective named Alex is on the hunt for a notorious criminal who has been terrorizing the city. During his investigation, he meets a woman named Maya who has retrograde amnesia and cannot remember the events leading up to her kidnapping and involvement with the criminal. Alex takes Maya under his protection and helps her recover her memories, but in the process, they both fall for each other. As they get closer, Alex realizes that Maya has a connection to the criminal he is searching for and must choose between his duty as a detective and his feelings for Maya.
[2/1/24, 12:16:20 AM] ‪+1 (201) 673‑8904‬: In healthcare, AI listeners are being used to intelligently document doctor - patient conversation in the medical records system. This is a huge time saver, satisfaction factor for the docs, and allows for a real dr-patient interaction. We are piloting this in our clinics.
[2/1/24, 4:59:37 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: One example where healthcare and AI appear to be a dangerous combination... business applications are ok in my view. I can not take it when AI replaces the doctor's analysis/brain/intelligence. AI needs to include interpretation, extrapolation, and analysis of factual, verbal, and non-verbal data, and in this case, symptoms, disorders, etc, which in my view cannot be replaced

[2/1/24, 5:13:08 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: Personally, I invest in AI companies a bit because most of the tech are now AI something. I try to understand and evaluate its risk of application at work (issuer audits and reliance on audit evidence when using AI) and see aha + oh shirt moments. I like to see it only as an aid. As a replacement only on a case by case basis
[2/1/24, 6:56:18 AM] ‪+1 (510) 386‑1430‬: This is Gen AI output, want to guess the input Tamil movie name?
[2/1/24, 7:46:35 AM] Mark Chockalingam: Yes these are great benefits.  We are using Ai for client call transcriptions which simplifies the note taking process.
[2/1/24, 7:50:56 AM] Mark Chockalingam: The question is the magnitude of the ROI.  Previously the doctor used to take notes. Then the recording was sent to a third party to transcribe the notes.

 Then it was sent to India to transcribe the notes to reduce the cost even further.

Now AI is doing the recording on the transcription. So what we have saved is the money paid to the Indian vendor that used to do the service. Probably a $3 an hour.

Perhaps an additional benefit will be the text processing by Ai to find patterns across multiple patients.

[2/1/24, 7:55:37 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: By the algos, and the team/developers behind the algos.. is there transparency on these, a big Very big concern
[2/1/24, 7:58:11 AM] ‪+1 (571) 306‑8289‬: Another way to look at this is: were we assured of privacy when the transcripts were sent to 🇮🇳? To any transcription agency.

But in any case this is a moot issue. The privacy ship has long sailed
[2/1/24, 7:59:37 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: I don't disagree.. the magnitude  of probable loss with AI is higher by several counts ‎<This message was edited>

I am now a convert on Mega cap tech.  Glad I was able to get back in thanks to October 2022.
[2/2/24, 12:22:19 PM] Mark Chockalingam: This is going to be huge.  

The outsized gains means the barriers to entry will be chipped away by competent new entrants.  

Apple and Microsoft may design their own chips as well.  The only company that seems to be struggling is Google!
[2/2/24, 2:48:16 PM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: $META - I don't think it is going beyond 500-510 (even a 490 short). 2 things - I am skeptical about the dividend (and the resultant payout to the CEO), and the buyback at highest prices (guess the value date will be somewhere in Mar may be). This is at best fishy. A short position to low 400 or even 380 where there is support in my view, over the next few months.
[2/2/24, 2:59:06 PM] Mark Chockalingam: What is happening with UPS?
[2/2/24, 2:59:42 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Up 200% should I sell then?
[2/2/24, 3:01:36 PM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: Yes - today's sell will still be profitable. I suggested my friends to buy a few days back. But, certainly didn't expect this big of a move. I would sell 80% of the entire value today, and hold 20% for a few more weeks
[2/2/24, 3:02:50 PM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: RSI at 87, certainly overbought :)
[2/2/24, 3:11:45 PM] Mark Chockalingam: shouldnt you be shorting NVDA?

It is with great sorrow that I inform you that Dr.Subbu’s mother, Meenakshi Nagappan, passed away this morning at 3:05 am. She lived a beautiful and blessed life for 86 wonderful  years.

[2/6/24, 2:55:16 PM] Mark Chockalingam: 4- and 5-Star rated “Dividend Aristocrat” stocks for 2024 by CFRA

01:59 PM | (MDT) | By: Monica L. Correa, SA News Editor


The CFRA’s Dividend Aristocrats is an annual list of stocks from the S&P 500 (SP500) universe that have at least 25 years of consecutive dividend increases. These stocks have four-star and five-star ratings from CFRA analysts. 

Analyst Raymond Jarvis wrote that from January 1926 through December 2023, the annualized total return for the S&P 500 was 10.37% per year, with a dividend component that comprises about 38.08% of the return. 

Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that “for 2024 dividends, the initial projection is positive, but minimal, due to the uncertainty of the economy, the timing of interest rates cuts, and the changing patterns of dividends.” 

He also noted that for the entirety of 2023, the U.S. common dividend increases were $65.1B, which was down 21.1% from 2022.

These are the 4- and 5-star rated Dividend Aristocrats for 2024:

Abbott Laboratories (ABT) - 51 years of dividend increases; 2% yield.

https://on.mktw.net/3SOZExV
[2/8/24, 7:22:35 PM] ‪+1 (214) 491‑7614‬: Interesting article. The rise in passive money creates more arbitrage opportunities for hedge funds. David Einhorn should be happy and not whine. However, I see his point. As index fund weight increases, it takes longer and becomes harder to realize arbitrage bets.
[2/8/24, 8:13:28 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Brilliant assessment.  

I don't agree with what Einhorn says - perhaps these statements could be a stunt as well.
[2/8/24, 8:15:41 PM] Mark Chockalingam: The mega cap tech as well as the Semis are right now in a MEME like movement with retail investors putting more money into these stocks directly or piling into indexes heavily weighted on these.  

His comparison of IVE vs SPY is also intelligently picked to emphasize his statements.
[2/8/24, 8:18:40 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Over a two year period Value stocks beat the SPY.  

All of this upside has been since November 1 of 2023 - when by some fluke I called for a 100% allocation to equities.  

But the mean reversion is waiting to happen - we just can't time it.  Luckily as individual investors we don't have to.  We have time and patience and we are not trying to arbitrage the market with leveraged money - so there is no pressure like the one Einhorn feels. ‎<This message was edited>

No body looks to buy $PFE / value when you know $arm   (which trades 2x premium to $nvda) will go up in price !! . Arm is not part of spy - therefore index comparison will mask the reality .
[2/8/24, 10:58:49 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Great point as usual Ram!  my only difference is - he is whining that the mean reversion will not occur because the valuation paradigm is broken ("forever" implied?!).  He is almost close to predicting that this is going to get more aggravated - the value distortion.  

I am saying Mean reversion will occur sooner or later - Fed/National Debt/Inflation re-emergence or plain investor indigestion...  At the moment investors are drunk with the possibility of Fed cutting five times this year and the infinite potential of Ai to take us to the moon!

The Big Game is set Sunday with the Kansas City Chiefs versus the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas.

"Regardless of the game outcome, we think the city of Las Vegas hosting its first-ever Super Bowl and the rapidly emerging sports betting industry are positioned to win," BofA analysts said.

The American Gaming Association expects $1.5 billion of bets on the Big Game, up 35% from last year, with DraftKings (DKNG) and FanDuel likely to be the biggest beneficiaries, according to the note.

Las Vegas is hosting the Big Game for the first time, with the average ticket price up 27% year over year to $9,014 and strong room rates. Caesars Entertainment's (CZR) Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM, a joint venture between MGM and Entain Holdings, are likely to benefit from the Las Vegas location given Caesars' high online sports betting share and BetMGM's new app launch in Nevada, the analysts said.

With the storyline of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, Swift "could be driving a portion of the higher ticket prices and expectations for viewership and wagers," BofA said.

“We know if these trends last long enough, it does not end well.”
[2/15/24, 10:33:16 AM] Mark Chockalingam: That is counter point to my assessment - I guess he is buying or he just bought SMCI and NVDA.

So DYDD.

[2/15/24, 9:15:15 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Very true. In a recent finance conference, CFOs and finance managers are complaining how difficult and laborious it is to clean data and analyze for financial reporting.  

PowerBi seems to be a blessing from heaven besides Excel where people sweat many hours to do what they need to do.  

And Ai Stocks are going through the moon without apparently solving any real world problems.

Contrary to our expectations the U.S. Market (S&P 500) returned 26% in the year 2023, despite a challenging interest rate environment and hawkish FED.  In the New Year, investors are quite bullish with the performance of the mega cap Tech Stocks and the expectation of FED easing in the year 2024.

In this webinar I will be hosting Senthil Venkatachalam from DC, Kapilan from Philadelphia and Ram from Dallas to give their investment perspectives.

[2/18/24, 6:20:40 PM] ‪+1 (631) 681‑2727‬: Many lost hopes on cook.  After Steve Jobs… no new products.. cook is just running the business. Even Berkshire started selling $AAPL
[2/18/24, 6:26:12 PM] ‪+1 (631) 681‑2727‬: Last Q… they sold 2 billion worth of Apple stocks.
[2/18/24, 6:36:38 PM] ‪+1 (631) 681‑2727‬: The only product came in was Vision Pro.  Meta quest is 650 and Apple Vision Pro is 3500..   Apple is not realistic in their pricing
[2/18/24, 7:00:55 PM] ‪+1 (714) 747‑6184‬: If buffet does something, there is some reason behind it. As Nvdia and lot of other chips are taking off, investors are taking partial profit and shifting from apple.
[2/18/24, 7:08:30 PM] ‪+1 (848) 219‑5280‬: I am hoping vision pro will do what the iPad did to the Tab market. 😀
[2/18/24, 7:47:53 PM] ‪+1 (631) 681‑2727‬: I don’t think so.  It may end up as a failure.  We know as Indians we are not going to encourage our kids into those..  The same with Jews and Koreans from my knowledge of interacting with them.

[2/18/24, 7:57:58 PM] ‪+1 (848) 219‑5280‬: Despite vision pro, when it comes to wearable tech, Apple continues to maintain the lead, I believe.
[2/18/24, 8:28:58 PM] ‪+1 (214) 864‑7326‬: VR is not a technology that can be used everyday, it might be good for gaming for 2 hours maximum and experience is surreal. I would wait for AR that is similar to Google Glass light in weight and wider field of view. At the moment meta rayban glass integrated with AI showed a glimpse of the future but we don't have the right screen yet.I think Apple released it as a developer model so the price was high. Currently Companies are creating their army of developers. I would bet on the unity game engine if you are interested in AR. even that may have impact because of AI which is changing Photoshop and the creative landscape covered by AI. It's just my take on industry.

[2/18/24, 10:41:59 PM] ‪+1 (661) 900‑3804‬: True but Cook did something which is not easy - brought in huge revenue through service. The balance sheet shift from "all products" to "product plus service" was magical and the service brings in cash almost perpetually. Their loyal fans continue to buy even if the product is sold without any auxiliaries and willing to pay extra for everything - current iPhone does not come with a charger! Unbelievable - $1000 piece with no power supply but they continue to sell😴 Every quarter he was beating the estimates. As you had mentioned this cannot continue and innovation with a new product is needed asap.

Microsoft also turned around their business model of selling software in to leasing software by which the money flow is continuous.

[2/19/24, 10:50:54 AM] ‪+1 (617) 259‑6727‬: Anchoring bias / effect is one where too much importance is given to the initial assumption / piece of info / initial purchase price when making a decision even if the ground reality has changed. Some may hold losers based on their initial assessment even if the stock has turn for the worse and fundamentals have deteriorated permanently. "In the context of investing, one consequence of anchoring is that market participants with an anchoring bias tend to hold investments that have lost value because they have anchored their fair value estimate to the original price rather than to fundamentals. As a result, market participants assume greater risk by holding the investment in the hope the security will return to its purchase price."    https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp#:~:text=Anchoring%20is%20a%20behavioral%20finance,when%20to%20sell%20the%20investment.

[2/19/24, 11:23:40 AM] ‪+1 (425) 247‑9506‬: how do we overcome it, I am in the trap with Paypal bought a falling knife at 2x current price. holding it thinking I am LT investor. am i biased?
[2/19/24, 11:39:25 AM] ‪+1 (617) 259‑6727‬: No easy way out. Taking a loss hurts. Make a realistic estimate of future potential of Paypal (assuming you don’t have it already) and weigh it with other options for new purchases. There is also the tax loss harvesting angle if it is in a taxable account to offset against profits. If retailers aren’t willing to sell slow-moving items at low margins / losses, we wouldn’t have a clearance aisle 😊.
[2/19/24, 12:10:42 PM] ‪+1 (214) 282‑7516‬: One option to contain/limit  further loss and still keep the potential upside is to replace the stock with LEAP option
[2/19/24, 12:14:51 PM] ‪+1 (213) 330‑9861‬: What is LEAP option
[2/19/24, 12:16:34 PM] ‪+1 (214) 282‑7516‬: Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities - Options with expiration dates longer than a year
[2/19/24, 12:44:31 PM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: I have posted a few times on $PYPL from Nov 2023 i guess.. i am holding long. The new ceo is good.. the margins are improving.. worth a wait for next few ERs.. gl
[2/19/24, 1:48:10 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Kapilan's points are well taken.  I also have anchoring bias but I buy a small lot thinking the price will drop as an entry point.  Then I do DCA.  

However, I have overdone this catching a falling knife like Bluebird bio.  At least this company has an endgame as it has three aprpoved therapies.  

Setting a stop loss at your floor price or 10% below your floor price is the best way to get rid of the Anchoring bias.  For example if I enter Microsoft at 400 thinking I will buy more as the price drops to 300 with a LT horizon of five years.  I may just buy 10 shares or even 1 share today as a record-keeping lot.  As I add more and the stock stabilizes around 300, I am good.  At that price I set a 10% Stop loss.  

at 270 I am out and taking a loss but it prevents a catastrophic loss of 50% etc.
[2/19/24, 1:49:27 PM] Mark Chockalingam: However caution is advised as new investors may over do this and can suffer huge short-term losses from over trading.  If you are following Kapilan's advice, they you should either set a comfortable distant stop-loss from today's price and review this only once a few months.  Not every day.
[2/19/24, 1:50:20 PM] ‪+1 (408) 806‑4340‬: Stop loss for very volatile stocks - very tricky, you will be stopped out then u want to get in, u will get into the wash sale issues in a big way
[2/19/24, 1:52:27 PM] Mark Chockalingam: One other question I would ask is will I buy Paypal at the lower price today?  

At the price that you are thinking about selling, I find today's price attractive to enter.  So in that case why sell if we think it has bottomed.  And a big IF.  has it bottomed?  

Fundamentals and other factors have a huge part to play.  If earnings are expected to drop and competitive factors are not great, then you have re-assessed this to make a decision.  If that is not the case, and is one-off earnings challenge, then may not be a bad idea to hold.
[2/19/24, 1:53:26 PM] Mark Chockalingam: yes.  If it is a taxable account, the game changes completely.  So reveiwing once in three months is probably better than looking at it everyday to decide on buy/sell/Hold.
[2/19/24, 1:55:57 PM] Mark Chockalingam: So no Easy answer when it comes to individual stocks especially small cap stocks - volatility is huge.

The easiest defence will be to buy diversified index funds - small, midcap and large cap.  

And have a long-term horizon say 10 years.

Then you can have an anchoring bias.  Keep buying as the price of the index drops.
[2/19/24, 2:02:43 PM] Mark Chockalingam: At times, stocks turnaround for no reason - accounting for all the reasons that we know off.  

I was so addicted to Spotify given how good the platform was among all of the music platforms and badly wanted to put some money at 80+.  

But it is a competitive sector, fear of Apple and Amazon killing anyone.  Spotify is a one trick pony or so we thought.  However, customers who are in spotify never want to look at another platform.... The Stock whipped the S&P by rising 200%+ since the bottom in 2022.

[2/20/24, 12:55:09 PM] ‪+1 (440) 610‑6180‬: I don’t know whether the capital market is reliable; not asking whether we are making money or not; 

For example Vizio let’s say shares outstanding 200m 
IPO 2021 $17.50 that is 3.5B 

Which today Walmart bought for $3.5b after 3 years 

In this people who invested $17.50 lost $2B cumulative market but definitely more everyone bought with hope and bought to average and sold to cut profit 

If the company always 3.5 b worth what happens to all those retail investors who lost their money; 

Interestingly Walmart market cap gained 15B today so they got it with 12B appreciation. No cash outflow; 

What I am learning is we investing making money short term is high risk! Invest on blue chips or big 7 and forget it for 3 or 4 years; but you want to risky ride keep averaging🤔
[2/20/24, 1:00:16 PM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: i think walmart bought for 11.50 a share, totaling 2.3b
[2/20/24, 1:03:57 PM] ‪+1 (440) 610‑6180‬: So they bought cheaper than IPO; and still made gain on market cap 8 times the deal;  we should move to more long term or my be I am getting older!!

https://on.mktw.net/3uFoNBN
[2/20/24, 1:57:38 PM] ‪+1 (440) 610‑6180‬: NVDA investors can afford if they are long term because 3 years ago it was $130 now $730 

Stock like Vizio had risks worse than crypto; 
Think like this 
Vizio value 2021 is 3.5b and in 3 years someone going to buy for 2.5b; will any of us invest in ipo $3.5b but people did invest aiming to get some short term gain of $25 first 6 months and from that onwards its falling knife with everyday average 2m volume sale; which is actually eroding cash from retail investors each day as they dream that Vizio will one day get back to $25 but it kept falling $16 $11 to $7 and today after the deal $11.50;

What I want you all to think is if it is a real estate we won’t invest in such a risky deal; but why we are investing in such a risky deal if it comes to stocks; 

1. Loss is bearable 
2. Process is simple
3. Others won’t know what we lose
4. We lose in three make money in one 
5. It’s like gambling people still like making money in gambling and lottery


So invest in stocks only if it is long term with the money you want to save for next three years.

Preserving wealth
“The father buys, the son builds, the grandchild sells and his son begs.” says a Scottish Proverb.

The Chinese have a saying, “Fu bu guo san dai”, which means wealth never survives three generations.

Ben Carlson in a recent article points out that about 70% of people who receive a financial windfall lose it within a few years. Also, nearly 80% of NFL players are broke or bankrupt after being out of the league for two years. Sixty percent of NBA players are broke after being out for 5 years.

Like all things in life, wealth is also ephemeral.

[2/22/24, 11:25:46 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Returns are better but rupee will get deflated so the dollar returns may not be as high.  Look at an Indian ETF denominated in USD to get an idea of the long term returns.

Right now is the momentum season and investors are throwing money at anything with a couple of vowels in the name.  

So invest wisely.  

Catching the high tide surf also means you will slide down when the tide turns.  

Remember Summer of 2022 - a few of you I met  vowed never to buy stocks again. 

Some said they moved 100% to cash - just before the market bottom in October.
[3/7/24, 9:59:41 PM] Mark Chockalingam: This doesn't apply if you are a great momentum swing trader that can safely get out before the tide turns down...

Preparing for a 20% reversal one needs to assess the prospects for high beta stocks.  Remember tech stocks fell 50% in 2022; NASDAQ fell 35% from its high.

[3/22/24, 6:34:49 AM] Mark Chockalingam: What is with Apple?!  It has been stuck at 170 for a while.

By the numbers this is not a value stock nor is a growth stock.  

2% earnings growth
7 times Sales
PE of 26.

It is hard to make a case to buy Apple.  

If the mega caps have peaked, then what could support the market to go up from here?

Fed liquidity?!
[3/22/24, 6:35:55 AM] Mark Chockalingam: Any thoughts by anyone adding more Apple.  I added a bit at 170 a month ago but I am questioning myself - only the Buffet factor supports it 

I am sure he has trimmed quite a bit this quarter...
[3/22/24, 7:15:46 AM] ‪+1 (714) 747‑6184‬: In last quarter. he already trimmed 10 million stocks. He may unload again. Recently, Apple acquired a Canadian AI start up,. But, very tough as Apple is bit behind in the AI game... Apple depends on China market as well, which is not good right now.
[3/22/24, 7:33:25 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: This is really what many do not understand,  and media including cnbc and others make culprit use of ignorance. What is 10 million is still 1% of his $AAPL holdings. This is a name many want to buy, and spread fud.
[3/22/24, 7:35:16 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: DOJs action is unprecedented, and against the capitalist ideologies. Also questions functioning of many such entities.
[3/22/24, 8:03:55 AM] ‪+1 (714) 271‑3539‬: Pending DOJ action
[3/22/24, 8:12:30 AM] ‪+1 (848) 219‑5280‬: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/22/24, 8:15:32 AM] ‪+1 (330) 329‑9857‬: In 1998 doj sued Microsoft and won. In Europe Apple has already opened the walled garden to an extent. The case will play out 2-4 years, but Apple will make concessions and open its walled garden eco system a bit. More than DOJ, Apple's issues will be China market share.  Not sure if this warrants selling... may be buying if it goes further down.... ‎<This message was edited>
[3/22/24, 8:34:19 AM] ‪+1 (848) 219‑5280‬: And Apple car is no more....😡 

Dreamed of driving iCar.😀
[3/22/24, 8:45:29 AM] ‪+1 (732) 331‑7285‬: Won initially, and lost on the appeals - so the MS split did not happen... Finally DOJ entered into settlement - to share the API's for third party developers. Yes, in a way the novelty dominates the market - but that is what patents and copyrights are for. Capitalism cannot fight capitalism.
[3/22/24, 9:20:10 AM] ‪+1 (661) 430‑3846‬: In china apple is going to partner with baidu for ai
[3/22/24, 12:56:31 PM] Mark Chockalingam: No Ai 
No iCar

Just marching towards iPhone 20!
[3/22/24, 12:59:30 PM] ‪+1 (408) 806‑4340‬: Trying to partner wit Google
[3/22/24, 1:00:04 PM] ‪+1 (408) 806‑4340‬: Innovation lacking under the leadership of Cook, for me it is a major concern
[3/22/24, 1:00:29 PM] ‪+1 (408) 806‑4340‬: Tech - Growth - Innovation must or no higher valuation
[3/22/24, 1:01:25 PM] ‪+1 (408) 806‑4340‬: Look at NVDA - One of the great innovation company thus you deserve much higher multiple
[3/22/24, 1:07:45 PM] ‪+1 (214) 864‑7326‬: Apple chip team is very good. Switch from intel to Arm was one of the best Apple did in recent years. Not only because of cost savings but such a huge performance gain and battery optimization. Qualcomm was trying to do it for years, but they couldn’t do it still. We haven’t seen a dedicated GPU from Apple yet. Hopefully they are working on it. If so, they are better positioned to run AI on device. AI training can be purchased from Nvidia and apple have money for it. But bringing AI to every device, apple is better positioned for it. It is not going to happen in a day but apple might be a winner.
[3/22/24, 2:51:21 PM] Mark Chockalingam: LULU - bought an initial lot
[3/25/24, 4:09:00 PM] ‪+1 (714) 271‑3539‬: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[3/22/24, 5:11:48 PM] ‪+1 (848) 219‑5280‬: Why Lulu, not Nike? Just curious.
[3/22/24, 5:36:41 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Not sure about Nike - need to do some research.

I bought a pair of ASICS and love it!  There are so many others in the market that Nike is going to see as a challenge!!

[3/25/24, 7:03:40 AM] ‪+1 (513) 508‑2166‬: I see many banks in India have Nifty 50’s ETF.. which one is suggested for Systemic Investment Plan(SIP) over a long term may be 10-15 yrs? Anybody have experience in investing in that?
[3/25/24, 8:48:37 AM] ‪+1 (646) 387‑1216‬: I think pretty much all the Nifty 50 ETFs have similar returns (Nippon seems to be widely trusted)- there is a very minuscule difference in expense ratio between these funds. For SIPs as NRI you can use Zerodha to get the SIP started with these ETFs - but the quarterly clearing of funds is mildly annoying  since you have to keep transferring the balance back every few months.
[3/25/24, 8:52:25 AM] ‪+1 (513) 508‑2166‬: Thanks Anand. I am trying to have my brother in India to invest in SIP in ETF on a monthly basis instead of the SIP he is currently doing with post office which yields 6% returns.
[3/25/24, 8:55:33 AM] ‪+1 (646) 387‑1216‬: ok then zerodha is still a solid option for resident indians as far as brokerage - and nippon etfs for nifty is good. I have also heard nifty alpha 50 is a good choice too if your risk profile accommodates it.
[3/25/24, 9:42:47 PM] ‪+1 (631) 681‑2727‬: I agree with you.   I was holding for the same reason of Buffet factor.   I came out as there is no innovation and no new products.   Apple needs a new CEO.

[3/26/24, 6:18:41 AM] Mark Chockalingam: We have been discussing this in another forum and wondering the same.  

With the deficits and debt on the rise we need a savior a la Reagan/Clinton.  But that is unlikely.

If this is indeed stagflation, the current market is in an illusory trap...
[3/26/24, 6:19:49 AM] ‪+1 (609) 721‑4813‬: Ok Annan. Thanks for your thoughts
[3/26/24, 6:22:51 AM] Mark Chockalingam: We need further discussion on this.  What do others think?!

Raising cash - if so what are the alternatives?!  Cash will also erode in stagflation.

The last one was in the 70s - the stock market returned zero for 10+ years.
[3/26/24, 9:55:42 AM] ‪+1 (661) 900‑3804‬: Much worse than recession.
[3/26/24, 10:49:39 AM] ‪+1 (315) 200‑5107‬: Wondering why the returns would be 0 for 10+ years when there is high inflation.


“real”/“inflation-adjusted” returns perhaps?
[3/26/24, 12:57:04 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Yes.  Slow and long drawn out pain.
[3/26/24, 1:15:22 PM] ‪+1 (661) 430‑3846‬: Inflation
[3/26/24, 2:12:14 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Bought UPS
[3/26/24, 2:30:19 PM] ‪+1 (425) 247‑9506‬: Contrarian strategy to market move. Do you believe in 3 year plan? I am thinking to open a position
[3/26/24, 2:31:42 PM] ‪+1 (425) 247‑9506‬: Good LT investment in my opinion.
[3/26/24, 3:09:50 PM] Mark Chockalingam: Yes.  They explained their strategy and committed to revenue estimates slightly higher than the analyst estimates.  

I like UPS better than FedEx and had been meaning to enter a few weeks ago at 140.  So today was an opportunity

[3/26/24, 3:24:30 PM] Mark Chockalingam: See above which is just nominal return during the decade of stagflation.
