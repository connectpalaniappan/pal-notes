[2/4/24, 10:58:51 AM] Palani aka Pal: Tips discussed by coach AK today 
- Keep you hands 90 degree to your legs when running to push against air.
- Do anaerobic running as it for long distance. Do not do aerobics running as it for short distance
- Do smaller strides
- Focus on time (40 minutes). Not speed nor distance.
- Keep your entire foot down. No heel or front foot first. 
- Don't open your mouth while running. You will inhale CO2. You need to save nitrogen with oxygen which you inhale by nose.
- Have a running buddy. ‎<This message was edited>
[2/4/24, 9:12:36 PM] AK Coach TNF Runclub Austin: How to Run the Program

During the week you train independently two days.  Sundays we train as a group.  Tuesday and Thursday are run/walk days.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday & Saturday  are "rest' days.  On your independent training days, you train by minutes.  A 40 minute session is a simple as taking a few minutes to warm up and then run or walk for 20 minutes from your starting point.  After 20 minutes turn around and go on other 20 minutes back toward your starting point.  Take a few minutes to cool down and you are done.  Be diligent getting your 2 independent training sessions down each week.  Consistency is the most important factor in successful training.


Your body adapts to the "stress" of exercise increasing your endurance and strength. The adaptation happens while you are resting.  If you trained continuously and never rest you would stop seeing improvements and start getting injured.  If you are new to running, you should avoid trying to do "extra" not on the schedule. 


During the early weeks of training you should be training at conversational pace. The goal is to build your base endurance and get accustomed to impacts. On these "easy" runs you should not be "out of breath".  If you are "out of breath" you are going too fast and you need to slow down.  You can either slow your pace or start alternating between running and walking.  The method that seems to work best for you is the right one.  If you are new to running or have not run in years, the run/walk method may be the best way to let your body adapt to both the aerobic and impact aspects of running.
[2/4/24, 9:14:52 PM] AK Coach TNF Runclub Austin: Thanks Pal for summary one correction. 
Do *aerobic* running as it for long distance. Do not do anaerobic (fast) running as it for short distance.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XPTNbFq0gfd_22k-XEOqMW4BV5Mj7DpkoN9pvvTXrvs/edit?usp=drivesdk
[2/25/24, 9:35:53 AM] AK Coach TNF Runclub Austin: Hydration


Brooks Running Hydration Article
 Hydrate before, during, and after any warm weather run
Proper hydration is like nutrition, you need to drink healthy seven days a week.
Avoid excessive caffeine, and avoid all alcohol the day before any long run.
On warm weather runs of more than 60 minutes include electrolytes (Nunn, etc.)
During the run/walk drink before you feel thirsty
Drink in small quantities, one or two mouthfuls at a time
To aid cooling try running with one water bottle and one ice bottle
For longer runs leave addition water bottles along the route
Determining Your Sweat Rate
To help you hydrate properly it is helpful to know your sweat rate.  The process is pretty simple.
Weigh yourself before you dress for your run/walk.
Do your run/walk and remember your time/mileage and the amount of fluid consumed during the run.
Weigh yourself again without your sweaty clothes and calculate the number of pounds lost.  A digital scale helps get a more accurate result.
Sweat Weight Lost = Weight Before Run + (Number of ounces of fluids consumed / 16) - Weight After Run
For example 190 pounds + (16 ounces /16) - 189.5 pounds = 190 + 1 - 189.5 = 1.5 pounds.
Ounces of Sweat = pounds of sweat x 16 ounces/pound  = 1.5 x 16 = 24 ounces for this example.
Assuming a 3 mile workout that took 30 minutes
Sweat Rate Per Mile = 24 ounces / 3 miles = 8 ounces per mile
Sweat Rate Per Hour = (24 ounces / 30 minutes) x (60 minutes / hour) = 48 ounces per hour.
For the same runner,  a twelve mile run in these same condition would require 96 ounces of fluids (6 pints)
This example is for a fairly hard run on a hot humid day. 
The runner consumed one 16 ounce bottle of water during the run.  To fully hydrate on the this run 8 more ounces, should have been consumed.  For a longer runs in hot weather it is difficult to carry enough fluids in handheld bottles.   You should place additional water on the course, find publicly available water to refill your water bottle, or consider wearing a hydration/fuel belt, that can hold larger or multiple water bottles. 


On hot days, it can be very difficult to replace all the water lost in sweat.  It is not necessary to replace all the water lost during the run, but you should be proactive in your hydration.  By drinking enough water during the week, you can start your workout well hydrated.  After your run, replace the water deficit over the next few hours. To avoid stomach discomfort you should drink small quantities (one or two mouth fulls) frequently during your workout.  Remember that workouts longer than 30 minutes should start to include electrolytes along with plain water.
[2/25/24, 7:11:56 PM] AK Coach TNF Runclub Austin: Dear Runners,

[3/3/24, 1:07:42 PM] AK Coach TNF Runclub Austin: Hello Runners,

We’ve hit the sweet spot in our 10K running journey. Starting next week, the recommendation is to run continuously, but feel free to adjust by incorporating walking intervals as needed. As we move forward, our running distance will gradually increase each week.

I strongly advise sticking to the weekday running schedule outlined in the plan. With spring weather upon us, hydration during our runs is absolutely essential. Remember to breathe through your nose while running and avoid mouth breathing.
This Week Plan:

3/3 Sun: Walk 1 Min Run 4 Minutes for 50 minutes	
3/5 Tue: Walk 1 Min Run 4 Minutes for 30 Minutes
3/7 Thu: Walk 1 Min Run 4 Minutes for 30 Minutes
Other days Rest
Happy running! 🏃🏃‍♀️
