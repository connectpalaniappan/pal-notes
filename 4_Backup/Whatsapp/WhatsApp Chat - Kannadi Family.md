Happy New Year!! 

We are excited to meet and greet everyone in this new year and celebrate Pongal with you all this Saturday (01/06) at 12PM. We have 45 families attending, with a total headcount of 158 (94 adults and 64 kids).

Here's a rundown of the agenda for the afternoon. Please make sure to arrive at the venue on time, and we're looking forward to celebrating with all of you. Thanks to all the volunteers who have signed up to help. Will reach out on the day of the event to co-ordinate.

Afternoon Programs:

Pongal Kids Ramp Walk:
We have 14 budding young (future Broadway) artists who will be entertaining us at the Pongal Ramp Walk personifying our cultural icons. They haven't revealed who they are, keeping it a surprise! 

PattiMandram:
We have an exciting Pattimandram panel lineup (please check out the poster below) ready to battle it out (They already have) leaving our Naduvar in dire straits. Check out their requests to Naduvar already.

Srini's Team: தந்தைக்கு உபதேசம் செய்த சாமிநாதனும், அவன் அன்னை உமையவளும் தமிழ் பக்கம் நிற்கயிலே திருவாழ்மார்பனுக்கு என்ன கவலை?! முத்தான தீர்ப்ப்பு ஒன்றை கொடு அண்ணாமலையாரே என்பது தான் எங்களது வேண்டுகோள்!

Sundar's Team: காந்தியே எங்கள் பக்கம் தான் இருக்கிறார் நடுவர் அவர்களே.... எனவே சத்தியத்திற்கு சோதனை தராமல் எங்கள் பக்கம் வந்து விடுங்கள்.

Group Games:

We have planned fun group games involving both kids and adults (Girls Vs Boys), involving movies, song trivia that will keep you engaged and entertained. Let's see who will score this one!

We must start the programs on time to avoid any delay in vacating the hall by 6 pm. If we run late, we may incur additional fees, so let's make an effort to stay on schedule. Also during Pattimandram, we request you bring any coloring pages & color supplies or other articles your kids like, to keep them engaged.

Celebration Attire
Please wear Indian Ethnic attire. Sarees and Veshtis are preferred. The weather forecast looks to be 54 degrees and Sunny. Please bring a jacket for the outdoor space. Keep in mind that kids should be supervised by parents in the outdoor area.

Get ready for a fun ride! You don't want to miss this one out. We have performers from ages 1 through 50+, who are ready to showcase their talents!

Thank you!
Gayathri & Suresh
