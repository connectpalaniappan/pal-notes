[1/4/24, 11:52:25 AM] Prasanna Hcl: Hi nanba, good morning. 
When you get time, Can you send me the details of the car shipping company you used?
[1/4/24, 12:03:03 PM] Palani aka Pal: Used uship.com to find the cheapest quotes
[1/4/24, 12:03:54 PM] Palani aka Pal: When I booked, montway auto transport was the cheapest and reliable  nanba
[1/4/24, 12:06:12 PM] Palani aka Pal: They would put a limit on the weight you can add. We paid extra 75$ to add additional weight. Though I don't think you need to pay it as they don't check.
[1/4/24, 12:33:27 PM] Prasanna Hcl: Sure thing nanba. Thank you.
[1/4/24, 10:38:40 PM] Prasanna Hcl: Bro, may I know how many the car shipping company charged you?

[1/10/24, 12:43:08 PM] Prasanna Hcl: Nanba, one small help-  can you please see if your apartment can extend your current lease for 2 more months? Before checking for month on month? 
Because, my previous apartment gave us that option. 
I think month on month could be expensive. If that's not an option we can go for month on month leasing. Thank you.
