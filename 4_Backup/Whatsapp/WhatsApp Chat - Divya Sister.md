[2/24/24, 7:35:48 AM] Palani aka Pal: Shall we make a video of Dad pics from childhood ? ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[2/24/24, 7:37:24 AM] Palani aka Pal: Here are some ideas AI gave pa 

Throw a big Indian feast with all his favorite foods like biryani, samosa, paneer, etc. Invite friends and family over to celebrate.
Make it a Bollywood themed party. Play popular Indian music, show Bollywood movie clips, decorate with Bollywood posters and decorations. You could even do a fun Bollywood dance performance.
Create a video montage or slideshow highlighting your dad's life from childhood until now. Include photos, video clips, and special memories. Interview family members for funny stories about him.
Plan a special outing for just your dad on his actual birthday - take him to his favorite restaurant, activity, or place that holds meaning for him.
Give your dad a gift that highlights his Indian heritage - maybe a framed vintage map of India, books on Indian history or cuisine, traditional Indian clothing, etc.
Take a family trip to an Indian cultural festival or event nearby to experience Indian music, food, and performances together.
Hold a small religious ceremony like a home havana with close friends and family to bless your dad and wish him well in his 60th year.
Surprise your dad by having friends/family make short video messages wishing him Happy Birthday that you compile into one video
[2/24/24, 7:37:49 AM] Palani aka Pal: Decide and let me know. We can work on it.
[2/24/24, 9:05:03 PM] Divya Sister: I feel we can have a combo of throwing a big Indian feast with his favorites and making a video montage or slideshow will do

[3/1/24, 10:39:35 PM] Palani aka Pal: Here are the suggestions by AI
[3/1/24, 10:39:38 PM] Palani aka Pal: Here are some suggestions for giving a heartfelt birthday speech about your grandparents:

- Start by thanking them for everything they do for you. Express how much you appreciate their love, care, and generosity. 

- Share a favorite memory you have with them, like a special trip you took or activity you did together. Talk about why that time was so meaningful.

- Mention some of their best qualities and what you admire most about them, like their kindness, wisdom, or sense of humor.

- If you have a nickname for them, work that in. 

- Share how they make you feel loved, protected, or happy. 

- Tell them how they inspire you to be a better person. 

- Wish them health, joy, and many more years with you. 

- End by saying "I love you" and giving them a big hug. 

The most important thing is to speak from your heart. Share what they mean to you in your own sincere words. Make it personal and don't worry about trying to sound formal. They will appreciate anything that comes straight from you. Let me know if you need any other suggestions!
[3/1/24, 10:40:06 PM] Palani aka Pal: Speak as much as possible and dedicate a song at the end. I will attach the song for the remaining video da.
