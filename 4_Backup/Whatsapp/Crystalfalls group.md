What you all think about this? Will it be helpful.
[1/2/24, 9:31:18 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Are we expecting inches of snow?
[1/2/24, 9:34:34 AM] ‪+1 (737) 287‑9078‬: Not necessary IMHO. Even while living in places with snow/ice, I’ve never used a cover and the compressor was just fine
[1/2/24, 9:36:23 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Theoretically, if it's freezing outside the heat exchanger won't kick in. 
Your furnace does not use this component.
[1/2/24, 9:37:48 AM] ‪+1 (737) 287‑9078‬: Hey folks. If you recently replaced a broken garage door spring, how much did it cost? I’ve got a single spring setup that snapped. Cedar Park overhead is quoting $380 plus tax.
[1/2/24, 9:38:08 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: That's reasonable IMO
[1/2/24, 9:38:53 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I paid a little more but I feel I fell for a scam to replace rollers and rebuild the door itself. 
Hindsight, won't do it but the door does feel smoother
[1/2/24, 9:41:01 AM] ‪+1 (737) 287‑9078‬: Good to know about the upselling that goes with it. Thanks!

[1/2/24, 10:34:51 AM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: I paid $421 for 2 springs last year with taxes and $20 coupon u can find in valpack ‎<This message was edited>
[1/2/24, 10:36:57 AM] ‪+1 (512) 216‑8758‬: I am seeing lots of leaves around it. So wondering it may go inside from top when there is wind.
[1/2/24, 10:42:23 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Blow the leaves out. You're also supposed to rinse or pressure wash it every six months. The heat exchanger becomes less efficient if airflow is obstructed

[1/2/24, 4:42:06 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: Hi, Anyone wanting to get backflow testing done?

All plumbing company contacts I got from few people charge $125+ for backflow testing.
In Portland, we used to pay $22 for backflow testing since plumber used to do wholesale testing of most of neighbors in our community.

I called https://watercrestbackflow.net/ and they charge only $85 for backflow testing.
Additionally they said they will provide 10% discount for each home if more than 4 people from our community sign up for testing on the same day. They are available this friday.

so looking for any other families who need backflow testing.
[1/2/24, 4:43:56 PM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: What's backflow testing? Do we need this for 3 years old home?
[1/2/24, 4:45:06 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: Not needed as it doesn’t  snow here
[1/2/24, 4:46:37 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: Backflow testing is an annual city requirement for any home that has irrigation system, which I assume almost every home has. 😊
[1/2/24, 4:48:05 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: It's not dependent on age of home...just an annual requirement...I am surprised by 2 comments so I am not sure what am I missing...

I moved to Leander 5 months ago and I got notice from City of Leander last month for submitting backflow testing results by Jan 15th.
[1/2/24, 4:49:05 PM] ‪+1 (512) 423‑0905‬: Never did it, from 2016
[1/2/24, 4:49:10 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: I never did for last 7 years, it’s another scam
[1/2/24, 4:49:30 PM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: Never heard/Never discussed here, looks like a scam...
[1/2/24, 4:50:54 PM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: I agree not depending on the age of the home. But just like any other service, some services aren't required for first few years in new construction. For example I called vent cleaning service after 2 years of construction and they told it's not required.

[1/2/24, 4:51:16 PM] ‪+1 (737) 287‑9078‬: You have to do it only if you have a septic tank
[1/2/24, 4:52:57 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: oh interesting...yes, I live in Grand Mesa & have a septic system....good that explains some thing 😊 thanks

but when we lived in Portland, we had to get testing done even due to just lawn irrigation system....interesting that Texas has different rules
[1/2/24, 4:53:06 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: thanks everyone for quick response!
[1/2/24, 4:55:11 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Yes, as said here. Not needed in TX as even with freezes, the irrigation pipes never freeze
[1/3/24, 5:08:09 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: Hi All, Any Honda vehicle repair shop recommendation? I have an expensive repair coming up so looking for reasonable & reliable shop.
[1/3/24, 5:41:02 PM] ‪+1 (860) 518‑1564‬: Try Lambs Auto near Randals. I got my brake work done there at reasonable price.
[1/3/24, 5:42:49 PM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: Christian brothers automotive on sonny drive is also good. Compare prices at lamb's and Christian brothers automotive both.
[1/3/24, 5:44:29 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: Thanks Bharatiya and Anuj 🙏🏽
[1/3/24, 6:18:21 PM] ‪+1 (847) 997‑5848‬: First Choice Automotive is another option
[1/3/24, 7:11:35 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Although expensive I get it done at Toyota dealership but yes other places might be better as long as they are trust worthy...
[1/3/24, 7:11:41 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Good luck 👍
[1/3/24, 7:12:46 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: This is good to know
[1/3/24, 7:13:47 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: In Oregon every home has to do this. Glad this is not needed here in Texas
[1/3/24, 8:07:54 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: How much is whole house water softener install cost now? Any good dealer? Will saltless be better option? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/3/24, 8:22:39 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: We had Culligan water softener and R.O unit in kitchen for drinking water. We used Potassium salt instead of Sodium. It was under 10k but it was a while back..
[1/3/24, 8:24:00 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: https://www.culligan.com/product-category/water-softeners
[1/3/24, 8:36:14 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: Thanks! I thought it was less than 5K
[1/3/24, 8:36:33 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: We got ours 5 months ago. Variation of price for softeners is huge…$500 to $8000 or higher
[1/3/24, 8:37:57 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: We chose something in the middle…we paid $3500 including installation although we had softener loop already in the garage

[1/3/24, 8:42:42 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: We got above softener which comes with whole house filter plus separate RO filter for kitchen sink.
So far so good
[1/3/24, 8:48:51 PM] ‪+1 (503) 330‑0140‬: When I researched 5 months ago, saltless softeners didn’t seem like a good idea.
[1/3/24, 9:23:43 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Refilling salt in the unit every now and then is a painful process. No escape
[1/3/24, 9:25:45 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Sounds like a deal 👌
[1/3/24, 9:40:30 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: I started using salt from
Costco & I feel that somehow is taking more time to melt so I have to replace it not so often
[1/4/24, 1:04:36 AM] ‪+1 (512) 277‑9792‬: I have one installed from hill country h20 they charged me 4200 for loop install and under sink RO combined

[1/4/24, 8:20:56 PM] Paras Photo Austin: We had a water softener loop, bought the tank from costco (~$400 in 2020), hired plumber for install, and refill salt every 2-3 months
[1/4/24, 8:46:28 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: How does only tank work, don’t you need some thing to run water softening process?
‎[1/4/24, 8:46:36 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: ‎image omitted
[1/4/24, 8:46:47 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Any feedback on this?
[1/4/24, 8:47:49 PM] Paras Photo Austin: believe the tank and salt take care of that
[1/4/24, 8:48:12 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: Ohh, ok
[1/4/24, 8:48:21 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: I’ll have to see it one time
[1/4/24, 8:48:49 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: $400 tha ya $4000
[1/4/24, 8:49:21 PM] Paras Photo Austin: hahaha

Come over to take a look
[1/4/24, 8:51:16 PM] Paras Photo Austin: it’s not super sophisticated like the carbon filter ones

for us, the costco one just works fine i guess

Probably stalwarts in this department on this group may be able to provide feedback/experience those who have installed the > $3k systems with carbon filter, saltless, etc features and the benefits of that system over the slat based tank system
[1/4/24, 8:58:37 PM] ‪+1 (630) 818‑0129‬: We installed ourself and the softner was about 1k
[1/4/24, 8:58:49 PM] ‪+1 (630) 818‑0129‬: We already had a loop
[1/5/24, 5:56:49 AM] Chakresh Sharma Crystal Falls Austin: I bought the unit from Costco ($370ish) and installed my self(<$60). This is a simple salt based softener. Carbon based is supposed to remove chlorine. 

Working okay for me so far. I have a undersink water filter though for drinking/cooking purposes.

[1/9/24, 10:28:34 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Artic blast from this Friday... Here is your quick refresher course/tips to prepare for the upcoming artic blast.. just in case....
1. Drip all faucets . It’s even recommended to run an thin stream of water . 
2. Cover your external faucets with insulation covers . This you can buy in Home Depot 
    3 . Drain your hoses and sprinklers. Switch off water and run the sprinklers , this should drain them. 
4. Propane based stove or a small generator can help . 
5. Stock food that dosen't need heating up . 
6. Get Firewood just in case . 
7. Cover outdoor water softner exposed pipes and system with insulation material. Get electric hair dryer handy.
8. Stock up one of the bath tub(first floor only) full of water as this can be used for anything other than potable purposes
9. Stock up on water bottles or big containers of water in the kitchen for drinking and cooking purposes in case of no running water
10. Stock up on canned goods like channa, black beans, tomato paste etc so you can cook even if you don’t have electricity as you can light up the gas with a lighter or match stick
11. Stock on pantry stuff, especially bread, peanut butter, honey so you can make a sandwich in the stove or a cold sandwich
12. Some stock up on dry milk powder so you can still drink coffee, tea
13. You can get shelf stable almond milk for the kids and once opened you can leave it outside or in the garage as it will be like keeping in the fridge due to low temps
14. Do not open your refrigerator or freezer as every time you open it during no power it reduces the coolness. Without opening refrigerator will keep food good for 4 hours and a full freezer up-to 48 hours.
15. Keep the cabinets open in kitchen and bedroom for warmer air to circulate and keep the pipes from getting frozen

Not sure about running the sprinkler with water off is a good idea though. I am afraid it might damage the system.

I decided to shut off water and release pressure at the valve. Since we don't have consistent freeze temps, I think it will suffice.

[1/10/24, 11:45:58 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: In Portland and Boise, we had to get the backflow valve tested annually and submit results to the utility provider
[1/10/24, 11:48:42 AM] ‪+1 (425) 737‑8159‬: Mine was in-ground.  I posted the pic earlier.  You can find it a few feet from your main water shutoff near the sidewalk.
[1/10/24, 11:51:45 AM] ‪+1 (425) 737‑8159‬: Close the inlet valve (marked in orange in the pic). Don't close the other one.  You want water from the line to flow out.

Use a short flat head screwdriver to turn the flanges open and let water drain out.

I had been eating a suboptimal kind of dosa my whole life and possibly you too if you aren’t from Karnataka. A couple things to note are to leave the dosa on the thick side, and to add generous amount ghee from above (if using non-stick, no need to add oil/ghee to begin with). Also check out his idli chutney - it is a mixture of coconut and peanuts and I think that works very well too.

[1/22/24, 10:54:38 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Central Texas has always been in a drought - flood cycle. The freezes are also not new. One could argue the freeze events are becoming more disruptive because the population has multiplied several times over and the infrastructure is strained even without poor weather. 
50 years of "small government" means TX has not been updating building codes, not restricting urban sprawl, not investing in aquifer preservation, not investing in climate change resilience etc.
Same old issues, maybe occurring more often, many more people affected, not any better prepared.

[1/22/24, 4:36:25 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Better to turn it off and call utilities so they can send someone
[1/22/24, 4:37:36 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Generally the gas tends to accumulate on the bottom of the floor so you can open windows or door for gas to escape and be careful not to light up a spark or a lamp

Is it recommended to go with 2% deductible on the wind and hail, lower on all perils?
Anyone has done it in the past and seen any unexpected consequences?
Thanks in advance

[2/6/24, 10:33:00 AM] Ravi Crystal Falls Austin: Every dent and every squeak adds to the character. Why fix it if it is working? 😀
[2/6/24, 10:35:30 AM] ‪+1 (832) 721‑1020‬: It became little tight when opening and closing the door. I hear the slipping sound when I close/open the door.
[2/6/24, 10:35:58 AM] ‪+1 (832) 721‑1020‬: Otherwise, as you said not needed 😀
[2/6/24, 10:52:31 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: It's not an easy diy but possible. Do not open/close the door as you're adding load to spring and opener. 
The fix involves disassembling this panel and using a 2x4 to pound the dent out.
The core is just Styrofoam and sheet metal fairly thin. You have to use the board to make sure not to dent it even more.
[2/6/24, 10:53:29 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I had to do this when the spring broke and one of the kids hit the garage open button before I could disengage the opener

[2/6/24, 11:07:19 AM] ‪+1 (817) 253‑8790‬: Now hit it from the other side. It will fix the problem
[2/6/24, 11:08:06 AM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Next time hit it hard so you don't have to deal with DIY 😄
[2/6/24, 11:16:14 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: There are 4 carriage bolts that need to be unscrewed. Bottom and top panels are easy to separate. It seems you'll only need bottom. 
What I mean is place a 2x4 wood board along the line you want to straighten. The length should be longer than the dent, maybe 4'. Then hammer the board which will protect the panel
[2/6/24, 11:18:59 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: It may be easier if you have a helper holding the other end when removing and attaching the panel. It's very long and somewhat heavy

[2/9/24, 8:07:46 AM] ‪+1 (737) 287‑9078‬: Despite more than two decades of research, there is
still not enough evidence to draw solid conclusions about duct cleanings benefits on IAQ, occupant health, HVAC
system performance, or energy savings, according to a 2010 review of scientific studies on duct cleaning. The
review did find clear evidence that ductwork can be contaminated with dust and can act as a reservoir for
microbial growth under normal operating conditions. Yet, even when duct cleaning was extremely efficient at
removing contaminants within ducts, the effectiveness of reducing indoor air pollutants was highly variable, and,
in many cases, post-cleaning levels of contaminants were higher than pre-cleaning levels.

[2/9/24, 8:27:21 AM] ‪+1 (737) 600‑6909‬: Dryer vents clogging can catch fire is what I read and dryers don't dry clothes properly and any bird nests in chimines and fireplaces needs to be addressed I think. I am not an expert but it helped the dryer in my previous house for sure
[2/9/24, 8:31:48 AM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: Dryer vents are required to be cleaned..mainly when you can see your clothes are not drying without any issue with dryer itself..
[2/9/24, 8:36:51 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I would not get all vents cleaned anytime soon. I got it all cleaned before moving in the house because I didn't know if the previous owner was keeping up lint filter cleaning in the dryer and HVAC filter replacement. 
With my own care, I know that both HVAC and dryer vents are clear and will not require cleaning for 5-6 years. 
I have a snake long enough to clean the dryer vent myself. May run it through in a year or two.

[2/10/24, 3:42:38 PM] Vamsi Crystalfalls Austin: Question for ppl who replaced their roof recently. How much did your premiums go up by ?
[2/10/24, 3:58:41 PM] ‪+1 (512) 351‑5113‬: Mine went little down for remaining term. They gave new roof discount . Let’s see what happens when renewal come end of this year.
[2/10/24, 4:10:01 PM] ‪+1 (425) 737‑8159‬: I don't believe your policy will go up because of roof change as it is considered as "Act of God".

But in general the rates will go up for everyone because of increased frequency of such weather issues in the area.
[2/10/24, 4:41:04 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Global warming and hence change in weather drastically is an act of mankind and not God 🤔
[2/10/24, 4:41:23 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Insurance companies know how to milk on premiums
[2/10/24, 4:42:03 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: They go by risk due to increased occurrence 🤔
[2/10/24, 6:08:27 PM] ‪+1 (408) 307‑2360‬: After I replaced the roof the premium went down a bit.
[2/10/24, 6:28:40 PM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: Anyone had farmers insurance and got roof inspection done with them directly. I got mine inspected by Sibi and only 2 side has damage so he thought it’s 50-50 chances for approval. What’s other experience with farmers adjuster.

I am looking to do a French drain. I was looking for an outlet I can hook it up, but can't find one. I am thinking I will drain  vertically down at a catchment. Has anyone done any similar DIY work?
[2/10/24, 9:29:02 PM] ‪+1 (408) 307‑2360‬: I have a French style drain, to drain water from my narrow side yard. I had it done by a sprinkler company. It could be DIY but it’s a bit labor intensive in my opinion. You could get an estimate from the company.

I have been with them for many years. My wife has her own too. 

Yes, the annual fee is high, but you can buy airline tickets with points at 1.5 times through their portal. Plus 300$ travel credit, yearly Priority Pass, Lyft and Doordash memberships, TSA Pre/Global Entry reimbursement etc makes it really worth it, again if you travel.

[2/19/24, 1:21:24 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Salaries are not going up 50%. So it can't be inflation 🤔
[2/19/24, 1:23:04 PM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: All roof repairs
[2/19/24, 5:51:44 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: I don't see anyone doing repairs. All are replacing it
[2/19/24, 5:52:41 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Roof companies of course they will prefer to replace and not repair 🤔
[2/19/24, 6:41:31 PM] ‪+1 (408) 816‑4941‬: They just come after harder than my Boss to get it replaced and hence wanted to make sure if my roof is really in need for replacement or they are looking to fill up their bank
[2/19/24, 6:42:12 PM] ‪+1 (408) 816‑4941‬: Reached out to the one that is used by few others here to get second opinion
[2/19/24, 7:36:07 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: This topic has been beaten to death several times over. Everyone that I know got a roof replacement only got shingles replaced. Very few if any had the moisture barrier or boards replaced. 
This tells me that the "damage" was basically missing or dented shingles. These individual shingles can be replaced and you can also pull a few around just to be sure moisture or impact didn't make it through. 
IMO, and I'm an electronics engineer not civil, roofers have preyed on the fear and doubt of homeowners and lied about the zero cost of replacement. Nothing claimed from insurance is zero cost. We all pay eventually.
[2/19/24, 7:39:31 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Whole roof replacement is necessary when you can see damage from the attic. That is, the damage has penetrated all layers. Or if the frame and boards are compromised and one cannot walk on the roof. 
Again, every job site I went to and watched, roofers were running around fearlessly on the roof. These were all very robust frames
[2/19/24, 7:52:26 PM] ‪+1 (913) 526‑8319‬: I second it. Roof replacement is the biggest scam
[2/19/24, 7:54:59 PM] ‪+1 (408) 816‑4941‬: Thanks guys for the insights .. Super helpful
[2/19/24, 11:05:48 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: That was my point and you were right on. ✅️
[2/19/24, 11:06:20 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: I will replace the roof when a tornado hits the house 🤔😄
[2/19/24, 11:07:54 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Technically speaking roofs are supposed to last 10 yrs. It's not like costco tires where we change every 2.5 years. Even for tires costco will do a patch and fix the tires 😄
[2/19/24, 11:08:51 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: I think the roofers have figured out the sweet spot that half of the homeowners don't have the technical know how and ends up dancing to their acts

[2/20/24, 6:54:45 AM] ‪+1 (612) 352‑0606‬: Last year I had few roofers inspect my roof since i was seeing minor leaks; the first guy just walked around the house and told me roof replacement is needed, he didn’t even address my main concern. Other two guys told me my roof is in good condition, except for some minor repairs. One of them eventually fixed the leaks by minor shingles replacements and sealing.

[2/20/24, 10:52:26 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Ideally, the dishwasher would be on an isolated breaker so only that can cause a trip. Have you made sure there isn't anything else on that circuit?
Does it trip if you run on the lightest setting without heat?

[2/22/24, 8:39:33 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: My advice would be the opposite. Take over diaper changes, night feedings, sleep training, the whole lot. That's really the only path to peace and quiet. If you let Mom deal with it, she wouldn't be happy and will not allow you to be happy.
[2/22/24, 8:41:05 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: If I got up and bottle fed the kids at 3 am at least Mom got to sleep. If she had to do everyone in the house and sometimes even the neighbors had to wake up.

I ran on light setting without heat (55 mins cycle) and it went without tripping…this was on Tuesday 

Yesterday ran two cycles on the regular setting with heat on (111 mins cycle)…as of now, both cycles completed without any interruptions…

So may be, whatever the issue was has temporarily fixed itself looks like 🤞🏼

And one simple advice from me, and I am sure every father here will agree.....kids grow fast. You won't realize the time. So enjoy with them whenever you can. 

Welcome to the fatherhood!!!
[2/22/24, 2:16:17 PM] Chakresh Sharma Crystal Falls Austin: Do you suspect any moisture or any kind of leak around the connection? 

I have an undersink water filter and once the faucet on the counter was loose so water was leaking in the cabinet. 

Check just in case any minor leak is reaching the power point.
[2/22/24, 2:21:12 PM] Ravi Crystal Falls Austin: Paras, do understand that kids grow fast also means you grow old fast 😀
[2/22/24, 2:22:49 PM] ‪+1 (512) 944‑6584‬: Totally agree with this; there will be testing times for sure, but then you will lay down next to them for a quick cuddle in the morning before school when they are refusing to get up and then all problems in life will melt away for 10 mins 😜
[2/22/24, 2:23:27 PM] Chakresh Sharma Crystal Falls Austin: I tried it this year. I liked the layout and the information presentation on this site. Search the reliability of this site, and there seems to be good reviews.

The current watering restrictions will result in dead lawns anyway but we should all plan for a low growth cycle going forward. This means cutting back or eliminate fertilizer, mow less often, leave a slightly longer grass and use organic backfill for dead patches
[2/29/24, 7:50:58 AM] ‪+1 (408) 966‑1459‬: Use a old phone or iPad to install the app and leave it home connected to wifi.
Once in a while take it out on a drive with a hotspot from your phone. So that they don't get enough data to bump your premium next renewals.
[2/29/24, 8:02:20 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Sabse best Tesla 😜

Every time you hard brake, premium will go up 🤣
[2/29/24, 8:34:16 AM] ‪+1 (408) 966‑1459‬: On other hand for EV cars if users don't use brakes much, just by stopping acceleration car slows down drastically.

[2/29/24, 9:02:23 AM] ‪+1 (650) 495‑2024‬: Estimated miles I gave was 7000 miles/ year to get 160 premium. I traveled a lot in the first month and the projected mileage by Tesla was 24000 and changed premium.

[3/1/24, 8:37:32 AM] ‪+1 (832) 721‑1020‬: To avoid this trick, Statefarm is giving a device to intall it in the car and the connection is only through Bluetooth.
[3/1/24, 8:37:31 AM] ‪+1 (832) 721‑1020‬: Even 60s can not satisfy their requirement. It's most painful to drive as per these insurance companies' app requirement. You really have accelerate/brake very very steady and slow. I gave up after couple of weeks.

[2/29/24, 12:26:09 PM] ‪+1 (408) 966‑1459‬: by doing this you can avoid the system to learn your driving behaviors,  schedules related data. Which increases your premium more for the night, distracted and/ reckless drivers than the Odo reading.🤫 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/29/24, 1:02:05 PM] ‪+1 (512) 636‑5241‬: Just FYI - some of you may probably already know. Just took my M3 for service. Tesla moved its service center to near Cameron road from pond springs. almost 23 miles away and, on top of that, discontinued offering Uber voucher for transportation!

I normally message ahead to confirm Uber credits. One time the guy got chatty about my X plaid and had an S plaid loaner ready for me
[3/1/24, 8:17:20 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Model s and x customers get a different treatment and service as opposed to model 3 and y

The prior gets loaners, uber, etc…the latter, hardly anything unless the car needs to stay with them for over 48 hours

Has been happening for a while now
[3/1/24, 8:44:01 AM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: This was my hunch as well. Model S and X customers were the early adopters and the middle class madhavans and madhavis get only a carrot 😄
[3/1/24, 8:44:02 AM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: I wonder if Tesla is making any money on Y and 3.. bigger models is where the margins are🤔

Especially after the price drop since dec 2022

I had an appointment far out in the future and decided to try walk in. I reached there early but the lady told me to get a same day appointment. They had a few available that day and I was able to snag one.

[3/3/24, 9:50:35 PM] Ravi Crystal Falls Austin: Not needed, but make sure you carry your old USPP that has the visa stamping. And your new USPP and OCI card. A small nuisance. Or you can get stamping on your new USPP
[3/3/24, 9:51:31 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Why do we need visa stamping as I have a OCI?

I have been waiting for last 4 or 5 days thinking that it will pop by itself. But, it's not popping, and pain is going up. I am thinking of going to the doctor so that he will give local anesthesia and make small cuts to drain the pus. Any idea which specialization doctor I shoulg go? I checked with my PCP.

They give low rental prices but then charge you by the hour from the time they go to storage to pick up drop off - pick up again from your place and drop off at storage for every person on the team needed for the assignment

For those who did not visit this place before, it's a good hiking on a small granite mountain. It's in Fredericksburg, TX (~80 miles from Crystal Falls). It's going to be half a day to 1-day fun tour for kids. It's a small hike. Kids can do it easily.

[3/20/24, 10:44:11 AM] ‪+1 (512) 277‑9792‬: Not sure I have to call them and enquire
[3/20/24, 12:45:22 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I guess they were lying about being on your side 😞
[3/20/24, 12:51:36 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I have screamed myself hoarse and it is unfair to blame individuals more than corporate greed for this outcome but this should not be a surprise for anyone. 
Insurance companies are for profit operations. They will raise premiums, deny claims and as we are seeing now even deny coverage to make profit. 
There are entire zip codes in FL where homeowners can longer get coverage from any insurance company. 
Similarly, there are zip codes in every major metro area where drivers cannot get comprehensive coverage and only liability is being offered. 
Insurance scams by the insured as well as body shops and roofers have gone to criminally high levels. The obvious next step in the federal government stepping in and "fixing" the system. Someone needs to see some jail time over this.

Republican states equate drivers license with ability to vote or an almost citizenship and therefore force undocumented to drive without license and insurance
[3/20/24, 1:06:52 PM] ‪+1 (737) 600‑6909‬: Any feedback on Progressive insurance Snapshot program? If you have YouTube or music on will it be considered using phone while driving?

[3/20/24, 2:23:38 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Once you reduce the population size for insurance the insurers need to spread the risk on existing cuatomer base. Also extreme weather and accidents increase the risk factor for them 🤔

[3/22/24, 9:38:29 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Anyone here have experience with flat tire repair for a Tesla at a non-Tesla shop?
I have a slow leak, pressure falls from 42-43 psi to 25 in 48 hours. 
I know the tores have a noise reducing foam but that maybe the case for other high-end cars as well.
[3/22/24, 9:41:56 AM] ‪+1 (512) 351‑5113‬: Try discount tire
[3/22/24, 9:54:25 AM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: Could it be just valve ?
[3/22/24, 10:08:57 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Will find out soon enough
[3/22/24, 10:16:21 AM] Ravi Crystal Falls Austin: Could be a stuck nail
[3/22/24, 10:22:02 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: This is not a diy at all 😄 stop suggesting root causes
[3/22/24, 10:29:59 AM] ‪+1 (408) 306‑2968‬: Try Lambs at CrystalFalls& Lakeline .. they do Tesla tire work...
[3/22/24, 11:32:54 AM] Ravi Crystal Falls Austin: I was suggesting fill air everyday and make the tire last another year or two 😀
[3/22/24, 11:43:40 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: I'm going 110mph everyday. Good tires matter at speeds
[3/22/24, 6:20:59 PM] ‪+1 (512) 277‑9792‬: I don’t know of any highway road in the nearby 100 miles that has that kind of a speed limit and Tesla’s are supposed to monitor speed as well right 😀😀
[3/22/24, 6:44:20 PM] ‪+1 (425) 737‑8159‬: 110mph? That too on Tesla original tires is not something I would try. They are low resistance tires to increase MPGe. I can feel my 2018 Model 3 start to give when I take the curves on 183 at 70+ mph.

[3/22/24, 7:52:22 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: In CA I used to check tire pressure every 6 months.  In OR I checked every 3 months.. 
In TX I check every 3 hours 😂
[3/22/24, 7:52:52 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Mohan, Good meeting you at the flight ✈️ yesterday 🙏👍
[3/22/24, 8:45:34 PM] ‪+1 (215) 485‑6492‬: U sure have leak
[3/22/24, 8:49:50 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: It was a 2" inch nail in the middle of the tire. $25 fix.
[3/22/24, 8:51:34 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: That's where the extra weight of X helps. 
And TX has no speed limits, only speed suggestions
[3/22/24, 11:01:27 PM] ‪+1 (408) 594‑5499‬: Yes Costco fixed it for $6.. or so. But the point is constant weather changes can mess up TPM..
[3/22/24, 11:02:42 PM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: I don't get TPM warning for more than 6 months. Not sure how common it is though. My average yearly miles are 10k-12k.

[3/23/24, 8:16:52 AM] ‪+1 (737) 600‑6909‬: I got the nail repaired in discount tire for free and they screwed it up and said patch didn't work right but luckily they accepted and gave me a free tire. Also the tire monitor shows wrong tire after the tire rotation. I tried reset multiple times but it doesn't. Have to get that checked out
[3/23/24, 8:28:13 AM] ‪+1 (408) 930‑8544‬: 😀 Same here. Thx
[3/23/24, 8:48:04 AM] ‪+1 (737) 600‑6909‬: I didn't catch this message. Good for you. I have heard multiple stories that a flat tire repair doesn't go well for a Tesla as the tires have that sponge and it's a miss and a hit to fix. Mine was the same scenario and I got a free one luckily. Hope urs is a permanent fix. 🤞

[3/23/24, 7:45:46 PM] Paras Photo Austin: Then why do we get speeding tickets in Texas 🫣🧐
[3/23/24, 11:54:40 PM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Where did you get a ticket? Williamson county sheriff is the only one managing any traffic. No one out in Austin proper. 183, mopac, 620 are all now designated Autobahn
[3/24/24, 8:09:28 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Mine was in Sunset Beach, Llano county in TX though
[3/24/24, 8:47:05 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: Llano and Blanco will get you every time. Sheriff have to generate revenue city PDs don't.
[3/24/24, 8:58:41 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Even Burnet county issues speeding tkts
[3/24/24, 8:59:01 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Par hai toh TX mein hi naa

Aapka message padh k khush ho gaya tha mein
[3/24/24, 9:01:07 AM] ‪+1 (602) 739‑5837‬: I have seen cops catching speeding cars on osage almost every week now. Wonder if they are charged with tickets.
[3/24/24, 9:22:23 AM] ‪+1 (512) 277‑9792‬: All said here still I cannot believe someone can drive 110mph everyday and escape cops 🤔
[3/24/24, 9:22:57 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: That makes sense to me. People speeding on 30/35 mph streets are actually dangerous while speeding on 65/75 mph highways can be done relatively safely
[3/24/24, 9:23:48 AM] Paras Photo Austin: May be @15127513530 is super lucky or may be using radar?
[3/24/24, 9:24:59 AM] Paras Photo Austin: In essence…speeding would be speeding, no?

Don’t get me wrong, i would love to know the hack where i can speed (over 10 miles of the posted limit) and still not be penalized
[3/24/24, 9:29:26 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: @15105095319 you drive more and different routes so don't do what I do. I only drive to the same 8-10 places usually into town or south Austin. Between 2005-14 and 2022-current only got one ticket in Blanco going to Lake Buchanan. 
Got pulled over around Circle C in South last year, 20 over the limit and the cop just chatted me up, no ticket.
[3/24/24, 9:31:50 AM] ‪+1 (512) 751‑3530‬: If you really want to open up your car and get COTA experience, I suggest any of the toll roads 183A or 45
[3/24/24, 9:34:48 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Woh raaz ho sakta hai…aap cop ko baaton mein uljha dete hogey

Not a talent I possess…

I have heard people walking (talking) their way out of getting tickets when pulled over
[3/24/24, 9:35:04 AM] Paras Photo Austin: Hahaha

Koshish kar sakte hai
