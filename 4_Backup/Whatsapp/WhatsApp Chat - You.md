[3/26/24, 9:39:46 PM] Palani aka Pal: Great question! For microservices resiliency, consider the following strategies:

1. Service replication and clustering
2. Load balancing and circuit breakers
3. Error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Service discovery and ephemeral instances
5. Distributed tracing and monitoring
6. Chaos engineering and failure injection
7. Design for failure, embrace impermanence

Remember, resiliency is a journey, not a destination! Continuously iterate and improve your microservices architecture to ensure it can withstand the unexpected.
