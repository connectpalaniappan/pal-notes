* The STAR method is a gold standard in answering behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing.
  * Situation
    * Describe the situation that you were in when you needed to accomplish. 
    * It can be from your current job, previous job or from any relevant experience such as volunteer work or college clubs.
  * Task
    * What goal were you working toward? 
    * Describe the challenge and what needs to be done to get a positive output?
  * Action
    * Elaborate the measures you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail. 
    * Describe the precise steps you took and the contribution. 
    * Talk about yourself rather than the team.
  * Result
    * Describe the outcome of your actions in a quantifiable way. 
    * Communicate multiple positive results. 
    * If the answers have a negative outcome, they should highlight your resilience or adaptability.
