# Introduction 

Spring Boot is basically an extension of the Spring framework, which eliminates the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.

It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform, which paves the way for a faster and more efficient development ecosystem.

Here are just a few of the features in Spring Boot:
* Opinionated ‘starter' dependencies to simplify the build and application configuration
* Embedded server to avoid complexity in application deployment
* Metrics, Health check, and externalized configuration
* Automatic config for Spring functionality – whenever possible
