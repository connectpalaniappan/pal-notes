Disaster recovery for pubsub
Do we need to stop the subscriber in passive center 
1. More errors are logs 


2. Config flag driven in application to subscribe or not
	1. Con: Pushing for config changes would take time 
	2. Con: Restart of application would take time 
	3. Con: 
	4. Solved by: Pubsub topic to consume config changes 
3. Number of the application running in passive center to be zero
	1. Pro: Dependency ie. pubsub/database mismatch is not possible 
	2. Pro: there is no need for having pods if they don't take traffic
	3. Pro: No application involvement
	4. Pro: Less resources 

brainstorm on how to migrate all microservices into K8s DR clusters in bulk after batch 1 is completed successfully. 

5. Dependency should not be created during DR 

Bottleneck 
Would the Kubernetes control plane hit harder when multiple services call control plane? No, Kubernetes can handle the scale.

ArgoCD would be showing in-progress when pods are not coming up in the passive region (solution 2)?

Enterprise edition would provide a feature to solve stale reads during DR cutover.
