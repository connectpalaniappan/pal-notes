# Introduction
Simply put, the Spring framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.

It's packed with some nice features like Dependency Injection, and out of the box modules like:
* Spring JDBC
* Spring MVC
* Spring Security
* Spring AOP
* Spring ORM
* Spring Test

These modules can drastically reduce the development time of an application.

For example, in the early days of Java web development, we needed to write a lot of boilerplate code to insert a record into a data source. By using the JDBCTemplate of the Spring JDBC module, we can reduce it to a few lines of code with only a few configurations.
