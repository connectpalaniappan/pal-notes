#### Pal Life Notes

Ask [[People_Krupesh]] for the consultancy number for uma

Life decision to stop paying for youtube premium as it pull me into a trap for long watch videos. That's 3200 hours for 3 year. Consistently watched youtube at least for 3 hours everyday. Don't think it was so productive.

Interesting plugin to use Kanban for managing whether to purchase an item or not. 
And plugin wordwise to calculate the words for each parts of the note. 

[[Cloud sync]] vs [[Backup]]
Good to know [[Dropbox]] provides [[version control]]

#### Pal Work Notes 

India data should live in India. 

Interesting point by [[People_Louwtjie]] that Proxy redirecting to read-replicas would not be useful for a read after write scenarios. [[pal-notes/0_Fleeting_Pal/Pal_Old_Tech_Notes/systemdesign/concepts/database/replication]] would atleast take a second to catch up. 

[[Pal]] mentioned an interesting point today that the current [[memcache]] setup is so difficult to add new or remove new nodes as the [[modulo hash]] algorithm is used by the [[spymemcached]] library to identify the key. This would cause a massive re-distribution of keys which would result in the increased cache fallback requests going to [[MySQL]] [[database primary]] . Provided a suggestion to use [[GCP memorystore]] as it uses [[consistent hashing]] algorithm to distribute keys.
