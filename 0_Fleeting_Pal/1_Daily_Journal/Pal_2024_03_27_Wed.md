# Journal entries 

Sometime, we want to add some repository (child repo) in a repository (parent repo), but want to manage child repos independently.

That's when we need submodule, you can [refer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsTthZi23VE&t=9s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) first

add child repo to parent repo (same clone), you can check `cat .git/config`. Then, you can add, commit normally.

```
git submodule add <link child repos>
```

In some cases, you are not pulling a Git submodule but you are simply look to update your existing Git submodule in the project. Like you code on module A but need to use the new feature on module B

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

when you clone paren repos, git do not auto clone submodule, you must update and pull submodule

```
git submodule update --init
git submodule update --recursive --remote
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

when submodule is no longer use, you can remove it

```
git submodule deinit <path_to_submodule_folder> -f
git rm <path_to_submodule_folder>
git commit -m "Remove submodule" .
rm -rf .git/modules/<path_to_submodule_folder>
```
