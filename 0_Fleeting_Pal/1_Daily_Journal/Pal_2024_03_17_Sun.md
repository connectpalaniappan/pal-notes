Am looking to understand the patterns related to solving an leetcode questions. For example given the constraint, to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, we need to use breath first search. Give me all the possible constraints and the related patterns.

> Certainly! In LeetCode problems, certain constraints often dictate the use of specific algorithmic patterns or techniques. Here are some common constraints and the corresponding patterns:
> 1. **Shortest Path or Minimum Distance:**
> - Constraint: Find the shortest path or minimum distance between two nodes in a graph or grid.
> - Pattern: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 111 - Minimum Depth of Binary Tree, Problem 994 - Rotting Oranges
> 2. **Connectivity or Traversal:**
> - Constraint: Determine if a graph or tree is connected, or traverse all nodes.
> - Pattern: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 200 - Number of Islands, Problem 543 - Diameter of Binary Tree
> 3. **Topological Sorting:**
> - Constraint: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), find the topological order of nodes.
> - Pattern: Topological Sort
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 207 - Course Schedule, Problem 310 - Minimum Height Trees
> 4. **Dynamic Programming:**
> - Constraint: Optimize for a problem with overlapping subproblems.
> - Pattern: Dynamic Programming (Top-down or Bottom-up)
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 53 - Maximum Subarray, Problem 70 - Climbing Stairs
> 5. **Divide and Conquer:**
> - Constraint: A problem that can be divided into smaller subproblems and then combined.
> - Pattern: Divide and Conquer
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 23 - Merge k Sorted Lists, Problem 240 - Search a 2D Matrix II
> 6. **Two Pointers:**
> - Constraint: Problems involving arrays or linked lists where traversal from both ends is required.
> - Pattern: Two Pointers
> - Example: LeetCode Problem 3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Problem 15 - 3Sum
> 7. **Sliding Window:**
> - Constraint: Find a subarray
