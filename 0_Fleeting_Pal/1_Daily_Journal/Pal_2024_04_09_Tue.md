# Journal entries 

- Prakash idea is to serialize and save each and every expansion in GetOrders 
- Serialization would save memory 
- Serialization would save CPU 
- Latency would be reduced when the database calls are made asynchronously  
- Though the number of database calls made would still be high and network bandwidth would not reduce. 

# Focus areas 

 - [[COS observability]] - COSoncall, Datadog, 
 - [[COS Resiliency]] - Netty executors, 
 - [[Capability]]
 - [[Architecture guild brainstorming]]
 - [[Work Learning]] - Platform brainstorming, Service mesh, google meeting
