## Coding interview 

> [!ai]+ Here are some of the key first principles to consider:
> When approaching a coding problem, there are several first principles or best practices that can help you effectively analyze, design, and implement a solution. 
> 
> 1. **Understand the Problem Thoroughly**: Before diving into coding, take the time to carefully read and understand the problem statement, including any constraints, edge cases, and examples provided. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear.
> 
> 2. **Break Down the Problem**: Decompose the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems or steps. This will make it easier to reason about the solution and tackle each part individually.
> 
> 3. **Identify Edge Cases**: Consider all possible edge cases or corner cases that the solution needs to handle correctly. Edge cases can often reveal flaws or oversights in an otherwise seemingly correct solution.
> 
> 4. **Define Inputs and Outputs**: Clearly define the expected inputs and outputs of the problem, including their data types and any constraints or assumptions.
> 
> 5. **Brute Force First**: Start by thinking of a brute force or naive solution, even if it's inefficient. This can help you understand the problem better and serve as a baseline for optimizing the solution later.
> 
> 6. **Optimize and Analyze**: Once you have a working solution, analyze its time and space complexity, and look for opportunities to optimize it using more efficient algorithms or data structures.
> 
> 7. **Write Pseudocode or Diagrams**: Before writing code, it can be helpful to express your solution as pseudocode or diagrams, which can help you think through the logic and identify potential issues.
> 
> 8. **Modularize and Reuse**: Break down your solution into reusable functions or modules, following the principles of modularity and code reusability.
> 
> 9. **Test and Debug**: Implement a testing strategy, including unit tests, edge case tests, and integration tests, to verify the correctness of your solution. Debug and fix any issues that arise.
> 
> 10. **Review and Refactor**: After solving the problem, review your code for readability, maintainability, and potential improvements. Refactor the code as needed, applying best coding practices and design patterns.
> 
> 11. **Consider Alternative Solutions**: Explore alternative approaches or solutions to the problem, as there may be multiple valid ways to solve it, each with its own trade-offs.
> 
> 12. **Learn and Improve**: Reflect on the problem-solving process and identify areas for improvement in your problem-solving skills, coding techniques, or knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
> 
> These first principles can help you approach coding problems systematically, increase your chances of finding an optimal solution, and improve your overall problem-solving and coding abilities over time.
