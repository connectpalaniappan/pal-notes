> 1. Present moment awareness: Being attentive and focused on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.
> 2. Non-judgmental acceptance: Observing thoughts, emotions, and sensations with an attitude of openness and curiosity, without labeling them as good or bad.
> 3. Compassion: Cultivating kindness and understanding towards oneself and others.
> 4. Impermanence: Recognizing that all experiences, whether pleasant or unpleasant, are temporary and constantly changing.
> 5. Interconnectedness: Understanding the interconnected nature of all things and our interdependence with the world around us.

> 1. Meditation: Engaging in various forms of meditation, such as breath awareness, body scan, or open monitoring, to cultivate present moment awareness.
> 2. Mindful movement: Incorporating mindfulness into physical activities like yoga, tai chi, or walking, by bringing attention to the body and its sensations.
> 3. Mindful eating: Paying attention to the experience of eating, savoring each bite, and being aware of hunger cues and sensations.
> 4. Mindful communication: Practicing active listening, speaking with intention, and being present during conversations.
> 5. Mindful daily activities: Bringing awareness to routine tasks like washing dishes, taking a shower, or commuting, instead of operating on autopilot.

> 7. Mindfulness-based therapies: Participating in structured programs like Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).
