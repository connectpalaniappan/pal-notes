  Courses: 
  I often get asked of the order I recommend taking my courses. I recommend taking the network, backend and backend performance in that order. I think understanding networking is critical to understand backend engineering, and to tune the backend to its best potential one is better served understand the fundamentals of backend engineering. I think its good take backend course before NGINX course just because of how complex NGINX is and knowing the fundamentals will make you appreciate that product. The database and python can be taken in any order. Here are $9.99 coupons for the holidays. Enjoy!
