### CooperGenomics 

Thank you for confirming your information. You will be receiving 2 links for the PGT-M with PGT-A test consent form from DocuSign in a separate email, which both parties involved will be required to e-sign. **Please note that we cannot begin the process without completed consents on file.**

**Please note receipt of fees does not constitute acceptance of a case. Your Genetic Counselor and or IVF Center will inform you if/when your case has been formally accepted. Should there be additional findings, fees are subject to change.**

The fees for PGT-M with PGT-A testing through CooperGenomics are separate from those incurred at your IVF center. The fees related to the test that has been ordered for you are as follows:

PGT-M with PGT-A Testing

- $5500 base fee, which includes up to 8 samples tested over a 9 month period. A primary fee of $2,800 is non-refundable and collected in advance. Remaining fees are due when embryo samples arrive at CooperGenomics Laboratory for testing.
    
- $525 per sample fee over 8
    
- $100 Courier fee, each time samples are shipped
    
- Base fee re-sets after 9 months
    
- Any future testing fees are subject to change based on current testing fees at that date and time
    
- We are required to test every sample sent to our laboratory.

_CooperGenomics is contracted with the following payors:_

- _Aetna_

- _WIN Managed Network participants will be invoiced directly and may self-submit claims_

 _If you know you have coverage with any of these payors, please inform your Client Services Coordinator as soon as possible to verify benefits. Any delay in coverage notification may result in our inability to file a claim._ 

Genetic Counseling is included in the testing fees, required and an important part of the process. It is possible that more than one encounter with a Genetic Counselor may be necessary. The Genetic Counselor will explain the testing process in detail, as it relates to you and your unique situation. The counseling session usually lasts 45-60 minutes. It is preferable that both you and your partner are available during the call (if applicable). **You will receive an email from the genetic counseling administrative team with an introductory video and instructions on how to schedule your appointment.**

Once testing is completed, the results will be sent to your physician. Post-test genetic counseling is also available should you have any questions related to the results.

If you have any questions or concerns along the way, please feel free to reach out.
