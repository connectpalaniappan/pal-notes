        Most employers won’t give you this advice for your 401(k)...
        
        You’ve  
        probably experienced this before: when you sign up for your company’s  
        401(k) plan you’re given a list of investment options for your  
        contributions.  
        
        Most often that list that sort of looks like this:
        
        VTIVX Target Retirement 2045
        
        VFIFX Target Retirement 2050
        
        VFFVX Target Retirement 2055
        
        VTTSX Target Retirement 2060
        
        VLXVX Target Retirement 2065
        
        VSVNX Target Retirement 2070
        
        If you ask HR for advice, they likely tell you to just select the year that’s closest to when you think you’ll retire.
        
        Who knows that answer when you’re 22 and in your first real job?
        
        So most people just choose the one nearest age 65.
        
        And they never change it.
        
        But  
        how these funds work is they automatically rebalance your portfolio  
        makeup (stocks vs. bonds) as you get closer to your selected target  
        retirement date.  
        
        Meaning you start off  
        more aggressive with a higher ratio of stocks to bonds, then over time  
        your bond portion grows to become less aggressive overall as you  
        approach retirement.  
        
        But  
        you can choose to be the most aggressive possible by always choosing  
        the latest year available (every 5 years) and then rebalancing in a  
        couple decades with the help of a financial professional.  
        
        Personally, I invest my 401(k) into VSVNX 2070 and will switch to the 2075 fund when it’s released.

    Most states have requirements for what type of coverage you must carry on your car. At minimum in most states, [you need bodily injury and property damage liability](https://www.iii.org/automobile-financial-responsibility-laws-by-state) that will cover the losses of other people if it’s caused in a wreck that is deemed your fault. There are some exceptions to those requirements, though.
    
    But your lender will likely require additional insurance coverage until you pay off the loan. Many lenders require you to also carry comp and collision coverage. This is the part of your insurance policy that pays for damage to _your_vehicle if you get into an accident that is deemed your fault.
    
    Lenders require this extra coverage to protect their investment. They want to know that if your car is totaled, they can recover the value that you owe them. Once you pay off the loan, whether or not you carry this level of coverage might be your choice.
    
    Talk to your insurance agent to find out what your options are and if you can save money by changing your insurance coverage. Just remember that if you drop this coverage and get into an accident, you may have to cover the costs of repairs or a new vehicle on your own.
    
    You can also [check rates for auto insurance online](https://www.credit.com/auto/auto-insurance/). In addition to saving money on your monthly vehicle payment, you may be able to save a lot on your insurance coverage.
