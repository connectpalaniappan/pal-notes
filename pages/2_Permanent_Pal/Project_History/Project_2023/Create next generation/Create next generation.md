        Urgent After-Hours Assistance  
        At Texas Fertility Center, we recognize the stress associated with fertility treatments, which often requires your  
        active involvement in symptom management and timely medication administration. To support you on this  
        journey, we offer after-hours assistance to address urgent inquiries that arise outside of normal business hours  
        and cannot be delayed until the next day.  
        If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911 or seek medical attention at the nearest emergency  
        room.  
        For the following Non-Urgent needs, please call us the following day during normal clinic phone hours. Please  
        note that we have weekend phone hours for time-sensitive needs listed below:  
        • To report the start of your period to begin a treatment cycle  
        • Positive ovulation test requiring IUI (please test before 12PM each day). If you have a positive test on a  
        Sat/Sun or a holiday, call the on-call nurse.  
        • Light bleeding or spotting in pregnancy, without pain or cramping (monitor, rest, hydrate and contact us  
        during regular hours).  
        • Prescription or refill requests. For oral medications like Letrozole/Femara or Clomid/Clomiphene Citrate  
        (these can generally be started between cycle days 3-5 and picked up at your local pharmacy without  
        issue).  
        • To request lab orders for CPL or follow up on lab results  
        • If you have not received medication dosing instructions by 6PM, please check your voicemail. If you did  
        not receive voicemail instructions, continue your same dose and call the clinic the following morning.

            - Ovulation cycle prediction
                
                1:  Call us with cycle day 1 of your period (full flow).  If this falls on the weekend, please call or e-mail us on Monday.  This will be your "prep" month.
                
                2:  Start using **Clear Blue Easy Digital OPKs** (Ovulation Prediction Kits) **on cycle day 8, Saturday 1/6/24 .** Please purchase the kits with the happy face.
                
                Fluid restrictions for testing:  Please empty your bladder at 9 a.m.  Restrict fluid intake.  Empty your bladder again at 11 a.m. and continue restricting fluid intake.  Test       between noon and 3 p.m.  You may resume fluid intake once you have tested.
                
                3:  Call us with your solid happy face positive result.  If this falls on the weekend, please call or e-mail us on Monday.
                
                When you call with your positive LH surge, we will ask you for your preferred pharmacy.  We will call out a prescription for 2 mg estradiol.
                
                Note:  If while testing for your positive LH surge, you don't get a solid happy face **by cycle day 20**, please give us a call.
                
                4:  Start taking 2 mg of estradiol twice a day starting 8 days after your positive LH surge.
                
                5:  Call us with the first day of your period and when you get your period, stop taking the estradiol.  We will schedule you for an IVF baseline (sonogram) on cycle day 2 or 3 and you can expect to start stimulation meds the same day or soon after that baseline appointment so long as everything looks good.
                
                Note:  If while testing for your positive LH surge, you don't get a solid happy face by cycle day 20, go ahead and give us a call on cycle day 20.  Our hope is that you will catch the surge and can start estradiol 8 days after the surge.
                
                You will need to start taking the Estradiol 2mg twice a day on 1/22/24. You will take this until you start your menses. Please give us a call with your cycle day 1 so that we can schedule you for a baseline appointment on cycle day 2 or 3. We will call out the estradiol to the HEB on Parmer.
                
            - Medicine prescription for ovarian suppression
                
                We received notification from the Clinical Team that you are starting your fertility treatment cycle and need your medications by the date provided by your nurse.   A prescription has been signed by your physician.  This prescription has been sent to Mandell’s Pharmacy.   Please give them a call at (877) 252-0553 to arrange for payment and shipment of your medication.
                
        - Second month
            - Baseline sonogram
                
                Your doctor will perform a sonogram to assess for cysts in your ovaries. If your ovaries are clear,  
                you will receive a copy of your stimulation sheet (flowsheet) with your medication schedule and  
                dosing and your first IVF monitoring appointment will be made. You will also receive a packet of lab  
                slips to use at CPL on the days of your monitoring sonograms.  
                
            - Gonadotropin administration
            - Pituitary suppression with Cetrotride or Lupron/Ganirelix
            - Follicular monitoring
                
                - Transvaginal ultrasound
                    
                      
                    
                - Serum estradiol
                
                - The frequency of these appointments will be based on your response to the stimulation process but generally occur every 2-3 days until you are ready for your trigger shot.
                - Every day that you have a monitoring sonogram scheduled, you need to have your labs drawn at CPL no later than 8:30am. Your doctor needs this lab result to help determine continued dosing amounts, so this is a very important part of the process.
                - For Saturday lab draws, there are a few CPL’s open in the morning and you can obtain a list of locations and hours at the TFC check-out area.
                - For Sunday lab draws (or holidays when CPL is closed), you can go to St. David’s Hospital (main location on 32nd St) for your lab draw. Go to the main hospital lab between 8am-9am and they will accept your CPL slip and get results to TFC by the afternoon. You must have your CPL lab slip to present at St. David’s as they cannot access electronic CPL orders or take a verbal order from our staff. There is one CPL option for Sundays between 9am-11am: 12201 Renfert Way, Ste 330, Austin.
                - Once your lab result is in, your doctor will review this result along with your sonogram results to determine dosing orders. You will receive a phone call late in the afternoon with the dosing instructions you will follow until your next appointment.
                - Please note that due to doctor’s schedules and surgery days, orders may not be given until late in the afternoon after the office phones have gone off for the day. We are still working after the phones go off and you will receive a phone all with your orders. If you do not receive a call by 5:30, please call the nurse on-call at 512-695-2530

- Medicine
    - Tips
        
        - ***Sharps containers should be discarded in your household trash. Please do not bring them to our  
            office or the surgery center for disposal. Lock the lid in place when ready to discard and you may apply  
            a heavy tape strip across the lid if needed.  
            
        
        - Gonal F tips: (Store in refrigerator)
            
            Each Gonal-F pen will contain an unknown amount of overfill – as much as an additional 25-70 units.  
            There is a way to fully empty your Gonal-F pen before opening a new one and prevent wasting any of  
            the medication. Even when you know there is not enough mediation left in the pen for your full next  
            dose, dial in your ordered dose amount, give your injection and when the pen runs out of medication,  
            the dial stops turning and the number shown is what is still needed to complete your dose. Then you  
            will get a new Gonal-F pen and dial in the number that was left on the pen that ran out of medication  
            and administer a 2nd injection to complete the full dose. EXAMPLE: Your ordered dose is 300 units. Dial  
            in 300 on your almost empty pen and administer the injection. When the pen runs out of medication,  
            the number left on the dial reads 225. Get a new pen and dial in 225 and administer a 2nd injection.  
            Follistim tips: (Store in refrigerator)  
            Each Follistim cartridge may contain an unknown amount of overfill of the medication. There is a way to  
            fully empty your Follistim cartridge before inserting a new one to prevent wasting any of the  
            medication. Dial in the full amount/dose ordered and give your injection. When the cartridge runs out  
            of medication, the dial will stop turning and you will then insert a new medication cartridge into the pen  
            and give a second injection to deliver the remaining dose left on the dial.  
            
        - Menopur: (Can store at room temperature or in refrigerator)
            
            When watching the injection lesson video, you may pick the option to use a “Q-cap” for mixing and  
            “Subcutaneous Injection.” Or if you prefer, there is an option to mix with a needle. Your supplies will  
            include 1 1⁄2 inch needles and the Q-caps come in the boxes of Menopur. Each vial of Menopur contains  
            75IU of Menopur. If your dose is 150IU you will need 2 vials of powder per injection, if your dose is  
            225IU, use 3 vials of powder and for a 300IU dose, use 4 vials of powder. Whether you are mixing 1 or 4  
            vials of the powder, you will only use 1ml of the mixing water (there will be excess sterile water in each  
            vial that you will discard, and if you are mixing more than 1 vial of powder at a time, you will have  
            unused vials of the mixing water). When mixing more than 1 vial of Menopur, inject 1 ml of mixing water  
            into the first vial of powder, mix and withdraw all the contents of the vial and inject that into the 2nd vial  
            of powder, mix and repeat this process until you reach your ordered dose. Gently swirl the vial to mix  
            (do not shake) - Menopur mixes very fast. Once your Menopur is full mixed, twist the 1⁄2 inch needle  
            securely onto the syringe and give subcutaneously. (Do not use the 1 1⁄2 inch needle to inject your  
            Menopur).  
            
        - Ganirelix: (Store at room temperature)
            
            There is no preparation needed for this medication. Simply remove the cap off the needle and inject the  
            full amount subcutaneously. Your doctor will tell you when it is time to start the medication and it will  
            be taken at the same time each morning until you have taken your trigger shot/s. Can be stored at room  
            temperature.  
            
        - Cetrotide: (Store in refrigerator)
            
            You will take the entire dose each time you are scheduled to take your Cetrotide. All you need to mix  
            and administer 1 dose is included in the Cetrotide box. It has been reported that trying to use a Q-cap  
            to mix the Cetrotide can result in loss of some of the fluid so please use the long needle provided for the  
            mixing. Swirl gently to mix (do not shake). This may take at least 45 seconds to a minute to fully mix.  
            Make sure to apply the 1⁄2 inch needle for your injection. Patients sometimes report a localized reaction  
            at their injection site which may appear as a raised reddened area that should resolve on its own. You  
            will be told when it’s time to start this medication and it should be taken at the same time each morning  
            until you have taken your trigger shot/s.  
            
        - Micro-Dose Lupron or Leuprolide Microdose - (Store in refrigerator)
            
            There is no video listed under either of these names so choose the Leuprolide Acetate option and it will  
            demonstrate the same administration instructions as this medication. This medication must be injected  
            subcutaneously every 12 hours throughout your cycle until you have taken your trigger shot. Store in the  
            refrigerator.  
            
        - Leuprolide-Acetate – 2 week kit – (Store in refrigerator once opened)
            
            This is taken at the same time each morning subcutaneously using the orange tip syringe. Dosing  
            amount and duration of use can vary depending on physician orders so refer to your flowsheet.  
            
        - Human Growth Hormone (Omnitrope):
            
            Each mixed vial of Omnitrope will yield 4 doses. When mixing 1 vial of Omnitrope, withdraw the entire  
            contents of the sterile mixing water, inject this into the Omnitrope vial and gently swirl until mixed.  
            For each injection, use the orange tip syringe and fill to the 25unit mark and inject subcutaneously. One  
            mixed vial will last 4 days - store in the refrigerator after each use.  
            
        - HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)– trigger shot – (may be labeled Novarel or Pregnyl):
            
            You will receive your mixing and dosing instructions when you get your call with your trigger  
            instructions/time. Please have your trigger shots ready so you can tell the nurse what kind of trigger  
            your pharmacy sent and she will provide the mixing/dosing instructions. You will use the 3ml syringe  
            with 1 1⁄2 inch needle to mix this medication but you will inject subcutaneously like your other injections,  
            using either a 1⁄2 inch needle or in some cases, the orange tip syringe, if provided. It is recommended that  
            you mix this at least 10-15 minutes before you trigger time as it takes a little longer to fully mix.  
            
        - Leuprolide Trigger (Lupron trigger):
            
            If you received a Lupron trigger from the pharmacy, it may come in one of 2 ways: a prefilled syringe  
            that you will simply remove the cap from the needle and inject at your ordered time, or you may receive  
            a vial of Leuprolide Acetate, along with orange tipped syringes. You will be told how much of this  
            medication to draw up when you receive your trigger instructions, and you will use the orange tip  
            syringe to draw up and inject the medication subcutaneously.

        After-Hours Medication Questions  
        After-hours questions related to medications are fairly common as many injections are administered during the  
        evening. We want you to feel supported and have multiple resources available to help support you during your  
        fertility journey. We ask that you take the following steps prior to contacting the on-call provider for assistance.  
        • Watch the educational videos on the injection in question on either the Engaged MD platform or by visiting  
          
        [freedomedteach.com](http://freedomedteach.com/)  
        • Call the specialty fertility pharmacy where you received your medications. Most have 24/7 support, and a  
        pharmacist available to troubleshoot any concerns or questions you may have about your medication  
        
    - FAQs
        
        I saw a few drops of blood come out of my skin after the injection, is this a concern?  
        o This is completely normal as superficial vessels can bleed but usually will stop by applying firm  
        pressure. A small bruise may form in 1-2 days. We would recommend avoiding the same injection  
        site in the future until the bruise has healed  
        
        - I saw a few drops of liquid come out of my skin after giving my injection, is this a concern?  
            o No, this is common and no additional medication is needed  
            • My injection burns or the injection site burns after injection, is this normal?  
            o This can be normal and the irritation will typically resolve in a few minutes. Cetrotide and Ganirelix  
            can sometimes cause a small, red itchy welt. Menopur injections typically cause a burning  
            sensation. If you notice swelling and/or redness that does not resolve, please contact the clinic  
            within one day for further evaluation  
            
        - I gave my Gonal F, Follistim, Menopur injection early/late today, will this impact my cycle success?  
            o No, we advise taking your evening injections between 6-9 pm. Being consistent helps you remember  
            to take your injection as directed. Slight variations will not adversely impact your follicular growth or  
            outcome  
            
        - What are the most common side effects of fertility medications?  
            o Injection site reactions including burning, light bleeding or bruising are common side effects  
            o Breast tenderness, abdominal fullness, increased vaginal mucous or discharge are common side  
            effects  
            o Your body’s response to the medications can mimic the signs of pregnancy and can change  
            throughout your cycle  
            o Severe side effects and allergic reactions to the medications are rare and not expected as these  
            medications mimic the hormones that your body is naturally producing. However, allergic reactions  
            can occur. Symptoms include but are not limited to full-body rash or hives, swelling, and/or difficulty  
            breathing. If you are experiencing a severe allergic reaction, please call 911 or go to the nearest  
            emergency room.

Based on this determination we have sent your prescription to the most reasonable cost-based pharmacy for the medications ordered. Please know that we do also request that you provide the pharmacy with your prescription insurance information so that they can complete an additional investigation to confirm coverage.  The pharmacy will automatically apply the cash discounts available for TFC patients.
