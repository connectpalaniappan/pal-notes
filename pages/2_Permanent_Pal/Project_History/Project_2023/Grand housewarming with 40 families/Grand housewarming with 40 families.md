    - Review changes
        - Can the Vinayakar and Housewarming wording be without blurring the home? And then a full drone shot of the home without blurring.
        - Will send the video of the two rooms to be attached tomorrow morning.
        - Shot at 1:40 and 1:51 is repeated
        - Always the order should be us(Pink shirt & red saree), my parents (Green checked shirt & Green Saree), then my wife parents (pink shirt & blue saree), then my aunt family (Blue shirt & Blue saree with two girls). This order needs to be fixed at 4:20 and 7:32
        - Green headband typing (7:01) seen for Pal at should be before the one where I have the headband (6:58)
        - Last song at 8:08 could be [https://youtu.be/g9PHTZLe4RY?si=MDHwJCKu3fkKG-QS](https://youtu.be/g9PHTZLe4RY?si=MDHwJCKu3fkKG-QS) Shape of You
        - Can the last shot be waving hands before “Thank you”? You can remove the full drone shot as it would be in the first part without blurring.
