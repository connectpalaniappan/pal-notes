        1. Lender fees are not needed when you refinance.
        
        - **What’s the difference between rate and APR?**
            
            - Interest rate - This is the base rate used to calculate the amount of interest charged on the loan amount annually. It's usually expressed as a percentage.
            - APR (Annual Percentage Rate) - This is the total cost of the loan expressed as an annual rate that includes the interest rate plus any additional loan fees and charges.
            - The APR is always equal to or higher than the interest rate, since it incorporates fees.
            - The interest rate affects the amount you pay in interest each month and over the life of the loan. The APR gives you a complete picture of the true costs.
            - Interest rates can change over time if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), but the APR is fixed for the term.
            - Interest rates apply just to principal loan balances, while the APR calculation includes loan fees and charges as well.
            
            So in short, the interest rate directly impacts monthly payments, while the APR gives you a standardized number to compare the total cost of different loans or lenders, including all the fees built in. Comparing both helps borrowers make an informed decision.
            
        - Under what conditions would you skip from having an impound account created by a lender?The main thing lenders look for is ensuring taxes and insurance will be paid on time. Meeting any of the above conditions makes that more likely so they may waive requiring an impound account. Here are some common conditions where you may be able to skip having an impound account created by your lender:
            1. If you make a down payment of 20% or more - Having at least 20% equity can allow you to skip impounds.
            2. If you have excellent credit - Most lenders will waive impounds if your credit score is over 740.
            3. If you qualify for a portfolio loan - Local banks often offer portfolio loans that don't require impounds.
            4. If you have substantial assets - Lenders may waive impounds if you have high assets and savings.
            5. If you negotiate with your lender - You may be able to negotiate no impounds, especially if you have an existing relationship.
            6. If you pay mortgage insurance upfront - Paying mortgage insurance premiums upfront can be a reason to waive impounds.
            7. If you pay additional points - In some cases paying points on the loan can allow skipping impounds.
            8. If you have prior escrow experience - Having a solid record of managing taxes and insurance yourself.
            9. If you have a lower loan amount - Loans under $200k-$300k thresholds can often skip impound requirements.
        - How do you calculate the amount present in prepaid/impound account?
            1. Here are the steps to calculate the amount that should be present in a prepaid or impound account for property taxes and home insurance:
                1. Determine annual property tax amount - Check with the mortgage lender or tax assessor's office to get the yearly property tax amount.
                2. Determine annual home insurance premium - Check the insurance policy declaration page or call your insurance agent to get the annual premium.
                3. Add tax and insurance amounts together.
                4. Divide the total by 12 to get the monthly amount needed to fund the impound account.
                5. Multiply monthly amount by number of months collected so far. Typically lenders will collect 2-6 months upfront at closing to fund the impound account.
                6. Add any cushion amount the lender requires. Usually around 1/6th extra of the monthly balance.
                7. Verify account balance at closing on the Settlement Statement matches the calculated amount based on taxes, insurance, and cushions.
            2. For example, if taxes are $3,600/year and insurance is $1,200/year, $4,800 / 12 = $400 per month. Collected for 4 months upfront means $1600. Add 1/6th cushion of $67, the impound account should equal $1,667 at closing.
        - why do few lender charge a percentage as origination fee and others have a fixed value ?
            
            There are a few reasons why some lenders charge an origination fee as a percentage of the loan amount while others charge a fixed dollar amount:
            
            - Business Model - Percentage fees allow lenders to earn higher origination fees on larger loans. Fixed fees give them a consistent origination fee amount.
            - Loan Type - Government-backed loans like FHA and VA loans have limits on origination percentage fees, so lenders charge a flat rate instead.
            - Competition - In competitive markets, some lenders utilize flat fees to attract borrowers with lower closing costs.
            - Cost Structure - Lenders with lower overhead prefer flat fees while those with higher costs prefer variable percentage fees.
            - State Laws - Some states limit origination fees to a maximum percentage, so lenders charge a fixed amount to stay compliant.
            - Profits - Lenders aiming for higher profits tend to prefer percentage fees that increase with loan size rather than fixed fees.
            - Simplicity - It's easier for borrowers to understand a flat fee instead of calculating a percentage amount.
            - Relationships - Lenders may offer relationship discounts by reducing percentage fees for repeat customers or long-term clients.
            
            So in summary, the main tradeoff is between variable revenue for the lender vs consistent pricing for the customer when considering percentage-based vs fixed origination fees.
            
        - what are the routine home maintainance services to sign up for as a home owner?
            
            Here are some routine home maintenance services that are good to sign up for as a new homeowner:
            
            - HVAC maintenance - Sign up to have an HVAC company inspect and service your heating and cooling systems annually. This helps keep them running efficiently and prevent breakdowns.
            - Plumbing inspection - Have a plumber inspect all plumbing lines, fixtures, water pressure and drain pipes annually to identify and resolve minor issues.
            - Chimney cleaning - Hire a chimney sweep to clean and inspect the chimney at least once a year if you have a fireplace.
            - Gutter cleaning - Sign up for annual gutter cleaning to remove debris, prevent clogging and water damage.
            - Lawn care - Hire a lawn care service to handle regular mowing, fertilizing, aerating and treatments to keep your lawn healthy.
            - Pest control - Schedule routine pest control services quarterly or monthly to prevent infestations and treat issues early.
            - Septic tank pumping - If you have a septic tank, arrange for regular professional pumping every 3-5 years.
            - Generator maintenance - For standby generators, arrange professional servicing and tests annually.
            - Garage door inspection - Inspect garage door balance, rollers and opener annually to extend its life.
            - Water quality test - Test for contaminants like lead annually and whenever issues are suspected.
            
            Scheduling preventative maintenance helps avoid costly emergency repairs and keeps systems running smoothly. It's worth the investment for peace of mind.
            
        - what are some of the ways to negotiate with a seller?
            
            Here are some effective strategies for negotiating with a seller when buying a home:
            
            - Make a solid opening offer based on comparables and market data. Don't lowball.
            - **Request that the seller pay for certain closing costs or repairs to offset your offer price.**
            - **Offer to increase the earnest money deposit amount if the seller meets your offer price.**
            - Waive contingencies like the appraisal or inspection to make your offer more attractive, if you're comfortable doing so.
            - If competitive, offer to escalate your offer price up to a maximum amount if other bids come in higher.
            - Note flexibility on the closing date if it will help the deal. Sellers may prefer closings before a certain timeframe.
            - Send a pre-inspection report noting issues and estimated repair costs to negotiate repairs or credits.
            - Get creative on incentives like agreeing to rent back the property to the sellers for a period after closing.
            - Offer to pay in cash if you are able to, since there are no financing contingencies.
            - Follow up quickly if the seller counters and stay engaged to show motivation.
            
            The key is using multiple strategies together, rather than just price, to make your complete offer standout. Demonstrating flexibility while also advocating strongly for what you need is an effective approach.
            
    - Josh followup
        
        Wire transfer - Should be fine sending a test amount and the remaining later

- Home inspection
    - Inspection questions to Chad
        
        1. **What were the major issues or defects you identified during the inspection?** No major issues. Lot of minor issues

        Hi Jenn/Lance,
        
          
        We have reviewed the inspection report.

            1. Parge coat applied on the concrete (Page 5).
            2. Check whether the roof has already been covered by their insurance? (Page 5)
            3. blanket lying on top of the attic floor insulation. Was there any water dripping from the roof? (Page 6)
            4. ask the sellers if they have ever experienced any drainage problems or may wish to have the main waste line video-scanned (Page 21)
        2. there are few defects listed by the inspector? How much are we going to discuss the compensation?
            
            1. Draining problems at the north and south side of the structure (Page 5).
            2. plumbing lines insulation is too close to the water heater draft diverter and is melting. (Page 22)
            3. Unused gas lines should be appropriately terminated in the laundry room behind the dryer. (Page 23)
            4. Construction debris and nails to be removed from the roof (Page 6)
            5. No drip edge is in place on the roof structure. (Page 6)
            6. holes in the roofing material should be sealed at the lower front valley (Page 6)
            7. attic ladder has a structural brace partially blocking access to the attic. (Page 9)
            8. opening in the soffit material at the northeast receptacle. (Page 9)
            9. the areas were the soffits and roofs intersect is open (Page 9)
            10. openings in the garage walls are a breach in the firewall. (Page 11)
            11. exterior wall expansion joints should be checked and properly sealed (Page 11, 12)

            13. vinyl flooring is bulging or lifting in various locations. The locations found may not be limited to these areas: at the rear exterior door and kitchen island (Page 12)
            14. Air leaks at or around the evaporator coil, hole cut into the ductwork (Page 18, 19)
            15. toilet is loose and should be re-secured and the toilet wax seal checked (Page 20)
            16. sink faucet has a slow leak when off (Page 20)

        Thank you,  
        Pal & Uma.

    - Privacy question
        
        Lender Josh
        
        Is it possible to abbreviate our names on the Deed of the trust?  
        No, it will be your legal names  
        
        2. Is it possible to have the loan under an LLC or trust?  
        Not on residential purchases, typically you can only do this on Commercial property  
        
        3. How easy would it be to move the loan to an LLC or trust later?  
        You can do either, but they recommend  
        waiting at lest 6 months before taking it out of your personal name,  
        that way the mortgage company is not alerted to any change in title or  
        ownership  
        
          
        
        Kathy
        
        Is it possible to abbreviate our name on the title document? –  
        The Deed will match the names on your lender’s Deed of Trust.  
        
        2. Is it possible to use a trust or LLC to take the title to the home? –  
        Yes, however, the loan must also be under that LLC or Trust.  
        
        3. Can we request for paper filing instead of having our name recorded on the internet? –  
        When the county files the deed of record, it will be public no matter the method of which it was recorded.  
        
        4. Request not to record our name publicly in the deed until closing. –  
        Here is the website for confidentiality with Williamson County.  
        [  
        https://support.wcad.org/portal/en/kb/articles/request-for-confidentiality  
        ](https://support.wcad.org/portal/en/kb/articles/request-for-confidentiality)  
        You will need to call them to discuss if you qualify to keep your information private and off of their website.  
        
        5. Request not to market, distribute, or sell your personal information. –  
        We do not sell your information, however, once  
        the deed is recorded, there will be marketers that reach out to you and  
        mail you things. There is really no way to avoid this.  
        
          
        
        Here are some tips to help keep your name private when working with a title company during home buying:
        
        - **Ask the title company not to record the deed publicly until after closing. This will keep your name off public documents until the sale is finalized.**
        - **Instruct the title company not to market, distribute or sell your personal information. They are required to comply with such requests.**
        - **Opt out of having documents with your name recorded on the internet. Request paper filing only.**
        - **If permitted, use a trust or LLC to take title to the home, rather than in your personal name. Add privacy language to the deed.**
        - Be present at closing to ensure no marketing forms have your information pre-filled out without consent.
        - See if the county allows use of a mailing address or Post Office box for title/deed records, rather than your home address.
        - **As last resort, request your name be abbreviated (first initial, middle initial, last name) on public title documents if allowed.**
        - **Do not provide your SSN, email address or phone number in communications with the title company. This data should not be public.**
        
        Though it takes effort, you can limit the public availability of your name during the home buying process by being proactive and utilizing privacy options. It is important to discuss these preferences early on with your real estate agent and title officer.
