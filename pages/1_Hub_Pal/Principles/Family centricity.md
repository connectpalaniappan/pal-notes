> "Family centricity" can be considered both a principle and a practice in the context of family-oriented systems or organizations.
> If it is considered a principle, it emphasizes the importance of keeping the family unit at the center of decision-making, policies, and practices. The associated practices to follow this principle could include:
> 1. Involving family members in the decision-making process, particularly on matters that impact the family.
> 2. Designing programs, services, or products that cater to the needs and well-being of families.
> 3. Promoting work-life balance and family-friendly policies for employees or members.
> 4. Providing resources and support systems for families, such as counseling, education, or financial assistance.
> 5. Fostering a culture that values and celebrates family relationships and responsibilities.
> 6. Considering the impact of decisions or actions on family dynamics and cohesion.
> On the other hand, if "family centricity" is considered a practice, it involves actively implementing strategies and initiatives that prioritize the needs and interests of families. The associated principles could include:
> 1. Valuing the family as a fundamental unit of society.
> 2. Recognizing the interdependence and collective well-being of family members.
> 3. Promoting strong family bonds and healthy relationships.
> 4. Respecting cultural diversity and diverse family structures.
> 5. Empowering families to make informed decisions and access resources.
> 6. Fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for families.
> In summary, "family centricity" can be seen as both a guiding principle that emphasizes the importance of families and a practical approach that involves implementing specific strategies and initiatives to support and empower families.
