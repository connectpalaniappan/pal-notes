> To determine if "Competency" is a principle or practice, I first need some additional context about the domain or field it is being applied to. The term "competency" can refer to different things depending on the context.
> In general:
> If "Competency" is referring to the state of having sufficient knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform a task or job effectively, then it would be considered a principle or desired outcome.
> The associated practices to develop and maintain competency could include:
> - Training and professional development
> - On-the-job experience and learning
> - Skills assessments and certifications
> - Mentoring and coaching
> - Knowledge sharing and collaboration
> However, if "Competency" is referring to a specific framework, model, or approach for managing and developing employee competencies within an organization, then it would be considered a practice or methodology.
> The underlying principles that such a "Competency" practice may be based on could include:
> - Aligning individual abilities with organizational needs
> - Continuous learning and improvement
> - Performance management and evaluation
> - Talent development and succession planning
