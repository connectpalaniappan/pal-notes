Idea from Arpit video on obsidian 

There are several ways to extract text from a PDF file, depending on your requirements and the tools available to you. Here are some common methods:

1. **Use a PDF reader software**: Many PDF reader applications, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, offer a text extraction feature that allows you to copy and paste the text from a PDF document. This method is useful for quickly extracting small portions of text, but it may not work well with scanned or image-based PDFs.

2. **Use online PDF to text converters**: There are various online tools and services that allow you to upload a PDF file and convert it to a text format, such as plain text, Word document, or HTML. Some popular online converters include PDF2Go, Smallpdf, and ILovePDF. These services can handle various types of PDFs, including those with scanned text.

3. **Use command-line tools**: For more advanced users or those working with large PDF collections, there are command-line tools that can extract text from PDFs. For example, the `pdftotext` utility from the Xpdf project can convert PDF files to plain text format. Other tools like `pdfgrep` and `pdfxtext` allow you to search and extract text based on patterns or regular expressions.

4. **Use programming libraries**: If you need to extract text from PDFs programmatically, there are various programming libraries and APIs available for different programming languages. For example, in Python, you can use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or the built-in `pdfminer` module. In Java, you can use Apache PDFBox or iText. These libraries provide powerful features for text extraction, including handling scanned PDFs, text formatting, and metadata extraction.

5. **Use optical character recognition (OCR) software**: For scanned PDFs or image-based PDFs where the text is not selectable or searchable, you may need to use OCR software. OCR software can analyze the images and convert the text into machine-readable format. Popular OCR tools include ABBYY FineReader, Google Cloud Vision OCR, and Tesseract OCR.

The choice of method depends on your specific needs, such as the volume of PDFs, the accuracy required, the need to handle scanned or image-based PDFs, and your programming skills or available tools. Some methods may require additional processing or cleanup of the extracted text, especially for complex PDF layouts or formatting.
